<h1> Early Roller Coasters Depicted in Large Scale Maps</h1>

Many modern coasters are visible in aerial and satellite photos.  See also the Google Earth and Microsoft Bing links listed on the park pages at the 
<A href="https://rcdb.com">Roller Coaster DataBase</A>.
<p>
Historical roller coasters are sometimes shown on large scale maps and atlases (usually at 1 inch = 50 feet, or 1 inch = 100 feet) that depict man-made structures.  
The most widespread of these include the fire insurance maps produced by the 
<A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanborn_Maps" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferencer">Sanborn Map Company</A> and its predecessors.  
The original maps use color to distinguish among various construction materials.  
Full-color digitized versions of maps for which copyright has expired are available for some states from the <a href="https://guides.loc.gov/fire-insurance-maps/sanborn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferencer">
Library of Congress</a> and other sources.  
Black-and-white microfilm copies, and digital versions produced from the microfilms, are available in many state, public, and university libraries, or by subscription 
through <A href="https://about.proquest.com/en/products-services/sanborn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferencer">ProQuest</A>.
<p>
Inclusion of early roller coasters on these maps is sparse, because the maps were produced first for the most built-up areas, 
while parks and rides tended to be located in outlying areas.  
Sometimes only portions of roller coasters are shown.  
Several of the earliest rides are illustrated here.

<h2>Circular Roller Coasters</h2>

Few early circular roller coasters are depicted on maps, perhaps a result of their early dates and poor longevity.  
The coaster at Cuyahoga Falls was shown (somewhat differently) in two successive editions.  
The Pleasant Beach ride closely resembles those described in the 1884 patents of Wood and Stevens.  
The maps of the Cuyahoga Falls ride show do not show a waiting platform, but instead 
show an incline leading to the high point of the ride.

<h2>Linear Roller Coasters</h2>

Four of thirteen linear roller coasters depicted on Sanborn maps correspond to locations mentioned in the 
<A href="myth.html#t1888">1888 list</A> 
of Thompson switchbacks (A, B, D, and E).  One is known to be an infringing copy (G).  
Sanborn maps for many of the other locations in the list were not prepared until later (Coney Island in 1895, for example).
