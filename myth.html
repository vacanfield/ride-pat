<h1>Stories About the Invention of the Roller Coaster</h1>
<p class="comment">
We currently have few contemporary accounts that shed much light on the invention of the 
roller coaster.  Serious interest in the early history of the ride seems to have begun 
only in the 1920s or 1930s, after the death of most of the earliest participants in the 
development of the ride.  Here are several earlier accounts, some of which were widely 
available.  Their accuracy is obviously quite variable.

<h4 class="title"> Sliding Up Hill </h4>
From the Augusta (Ga.) Chronicle, June 24.
<p>
Mr. Wood, at one time a poor carpenter of Toledo, Ohio, is the inventor of the circular 
railroad, having conceived the idea from witnessing children slide down the hills on 
their slide-boards, he arguing that if they could slide down hill they could slide up 
hill, a demonstration of which is witnessed in the circular railway.

He was the inventor of the now famous "loop-the-loop," which for a time did a precarious 
business at the Casino grounds.  The "loop-the-loop" is now to be found at Coney Island 
in numbers and also in many other summer resorts.  From this invention Mr. Wood received 
immense sums, and he is now comfortably fixed for life.

Wood was one of the original inventors of the roller skate.  He perfected the first model

Two years afterward he invented the first roller coaster, the forerunner of the 
"Figure 8."  This was his most profitable invention.  He sold the rights in this coaster 
on a royalty basis, and made over $17,000 in one year.

<div class="blockquote">
<h4 class="title"> Thompson's Gravity System for Rapid Transit in Towns and Cities</h4>
A new system of operating passenger railroads in towns and cities, in which the cars are 
operated by gravity, is shown in our first page illustrations, the distances apart of 
the stations being approximately such as would be represented by the passenger stations 
on a city railway.  The operative features of such a construction have had numerous 
illustrations in various switchback railways and coasting tracks at seaside resorts and 
other places, not to mention the famous switchback road at Mauch Chunk, Penn., which was 
used for many years to convey coal from the mines to the banks of the Lehigh, and where 
the inclines are extensive.  It has, however, remained for Mr. L. A. Thompson, of 
Philadelphia, to perfect the working details for the operation of a city railroad on 
this plan, for which letters patent have been granted to him here and in all the 
principal countries of the world.
<p>
...
<p id="t1888">
Mr. Thompson has had much experience in building gravity roads.  He erected numerous 
switchback railway coasting tracks in this country prior to 1887, when he went abroad and 
built a score or more of such roads in England and France, which have proved a great 
attraction at numerous seaside resorts, watering places, and centers of public resort.  
Our contemporary, La Nature, in describing these railways, recently gave Mr. Thompson due 
credit as the constructor, but said he was an Englishman.  He is, however, a wide-awake, 
enterprising American.</p>
<p>
The Thompson gravity or switchback roads are now in operation in Atlantic City, Lakeside, Gloucester, Paterson, N. J.; Neshaminy Falls, Chestnut Grove, Pa; Bay Ridge, Md.; Washington, D.C.; Alexandria, Richmond, Va.; Coney Island, Bowery Bay, Oak Point, Saratoga, Rockaway Beach, Rochester, N. Y.; Cheltenham Beach, Chicago; Reeds Lake, Grand Rapids; Coronado Beach, Santa Monica, Cal.; Providence, R. I.
<p>
Of the Thompson roads there are also now in operation, in London, three.  Of the roadways, in Manchester, two; Newcastle-on-Tyne, one; Blackpool, one; Liverpool, two; Douglas (Isle of Man), two; one in Brighton, Skegness, Great Grimsby, Great Yarmouth, and Folkestone; in Glasgow, two;  Hull, one; in Paris, three; Boulogne, one; Barcelona, Spain, one.  Millions of passengers have been carried on these gravity roadways, and we believe no serious accident has ever occurred on them.  The form of these roads, as erected by Mr. Thompson, will be seen by reference to the engraving of the roadway built by him at Boulogne, given on page 150.

<h4 class="title">The Safety and Success of the Switchback.<br>
An Interview with the General Manager of the Switchback Railway Company.</h4>
The switchback is safety itself, and the very essence of the concern, that which gives it its name, is the switch by which the car is switched from one line of rails and run into another.  It is quite impossible for such an accident to happen on a switchback railway as that which happened on the roller-coaster at the Crystal Palace.  The roller-coaster is an ancient invention by which two cars in rapid succession run rapidly down a curved incline and then ascend about half-way to their original level at the other end of the curve.  The breaks did not work, and the ascending car descended, with consequences horrible to contemplate.  On the switchback, supposing that a car did run backwards, it would not run into anything; the possibility of risk is minimized.
<p>
...
<p>
The switchback is one of the greatest successes of the day.  It was only last year that Mr. Thompson established the first switchback ever seen in active operation in England.  Long ago, there used to be something like a switchback in the Tivoli Gardens at Copenhagen, and again seventy years ago in Paris, where the Montagnes des Russes had a great vogue.  Although there have been no end of inventions showing on paper how a railway could be made something like the switchback, Mr. Thompson, last year, was the first man who ever proved by actual demonstration that the switchback could be made and worked with perfect safety in this country.

Mr. Thompson, the inventor of the switchback railway and of the "scenic railway" used at the World's fair, hopes to see passengers for Courtland Beach heeding the cry:  "Hold your hats," and sliding between the beach and Sherman avenue.  He has lately visited this city and made an off-hand survey of the land between the avenue and that pleasure resort and has pronounced such a road practicable.  He has given an estimate to the beach company, but it will not contract for such a road this year.  The expense is enormous and besides many people would be nervous about taking the ride.

Mr. L. A. Thompson is the inventor of the scenic railway and is present to superintend the construction.  He is a man of considerable reputation in his line, which is gravity railway building.  He built his first successful gravity road at Coney Island, N. Y., in 1884.  Then he went to London in 1887 and operated his switch-back railroad during the queen's jubilee.  It was a "howling success" and divided honors with Buffalo Bill's Wild West show.

<div class="blockquote">
<h4 class="title">A Fortune in Fun</h4>
How millions have been made out of the lightest and apparently most ridiculous amusement devices, and how the American public has made Coney Island and its ilk a national institution is told most interestingly by Reginald Wright Kauffman in Hampton's Magazine.  He says:
<p>
A little more than twenty-five years ago Mr. L. A. Thompson, a mechanical engineer, then in the West in search of health, saw a mountain gravity road in operation in connection with a mine, and, remembering that the contemporary amusement parks were strangers to all devices save seesaws, box swings and merry-go-rounds for children, he began to wonder if it wouldn't pay him to go from one of these places to another and superintend the construction of gravity roads, the freight of which would be not ore, but adult, amusement-seeking humanity.
<p>
Thompson made drawings.  He got a piece of ground.  Then, doing much of the work with his own hands, he built his road and proved his theory.
<p>
It was a trivial thing, that first switch-back, compared with the sort that you may ride in today.  Ten persons at a time climbed a long flight of steps and clambered into a car that promptly dropped them down an incline of 450 feet.  Then they got out, climbed another flight of steps, and swarmed into another car which brought them to their place of departure.  The entire contrivance had cost just $1,600, but Thompson had "made good."
<p>
Park owners changed their scoffing to imitating, because the switchback was emptying their own places, but their change was only the traditional one from frying pan to fire, because the canny Mr. Thompson had made a few quiet trips to Washington and had protected his device by a series of iron-barred and time-locked patents.  Today he is a millionaire, is at the head of a company capitalized at $900,000, and builds scenic railways (he is just now in London, building one) which, running over a mile and carrying sometimes twenty-eight persons to the car, frequently cost $100,000 each.

<h4 class="title">Making Thrills for Coney</h4>
[by Henry McMahon, in the New York Evening Post]
<p>
Pleasure railways came into existence about 26 years ago.  L. A. Thompson and S. E. Jackman have each been credited with the honor of being the pioneer.  While Thompson was putting up his first primitive "switchback," where now runs the Sea Beach Walk at Coney Island, Jackman was building his first toboggan slide around the interior of the Globe roller skating rink at Haverhill, Mass.  
</div>


New York Daily Tribune<br>
September 11, 1910
<div class="blockquote">
This is the story of the origin of the roller coaster.  L. N. Thompson was riding in a train once when he saw some boys sliding down hill.  Now, Mr. Thompson had been born in Indiana, and afterward had lived in Arizona.  There were no hills about his Indiana home and there was no snow in Arizona.  As he looked at the boys he felt as if he had been deprived of his birthright in his own boyhood and declared that he would like to go sliding then and there.
<p>
The more he thought it over, the surer he became that thousands of grown-up people everywhere must feel the same way.  If he could make it respectable for grown-ups to go sliding, he believed they would like it.  Thereupon he bought a ticket for a Pennsylvania town where he had heard that a coal company was running a road by gravity, coasting its cars down one hill with force enough to take them up another.  The plan worked perfectly, so Mr. Thompson experimented for a while, perfected plans for guarding his passengers' safety and took out patents on his road.  This was the "switchback" which was built in Coney Island in 1884.

After having spent eight months on the desert, Mr. Thompson started east again.  He had seen a fellow operating a coaster in a park in New Orleans which gave him the idea for his scenic railway and he wanted to get back east and try it out.  After many difficulties he succeeded in erecting a plant at Coney Island but did not know how the public would take to it.  On the Sunday announced for the opening, he was very apprehensive but the railroad was packed to capacity all day and night found him with several bushel baskets full of money.  The roller coaster was a success from that day on.

<h4 class="title"> L. A. Thompson Dead.<br>
Inventor of Scenic Railway Dies at His Home, Thompson Park.</h4>
LaMarcus Adna Thompson, well-known inventor of the Thompson Scenic Railway and other devices, and managing director of the L. A. Thompson Scenic Railway Company, 220 West Forty-second Street, died last night at his home, Thompson Park, Glen Cove, L. I., at the age of 71 years.
<p>
Mr. Thompson, was born at Jersey, Licking County, Ohio, March 8, 1848.  The spare moments of young Thompson in Ohio, were devoted to the inventing, building, and operating of mechanical toys, such as cross-bows, carts, wagons, etc.  After attending Hillsdale College for a short time he completed his schooling in 1866 and then engaged in the wagon and carriage business.  In 1873 he moved to Elkhart, Ind., where, besides operating a grocery store, he turned his attention to invention, his first device being for the manufacture of seamless hosiery.  A factory was started and in a short time the annual business was running over $250,000 a year, when Mr. Thompson's health failed and he sold his interest.
<p>
Returning to Elkhart after a period of recuperation in Arizona, he invented the switch-back railway which, through subsequent improvements, developed into the Thompson Scenic Railway.  It was first patented in 1884, and during the next three years nearly thirty patents were granted Mr. Thompson for the many devices he applied to scenic railways.  In 1895 he incorporated as the L. A. Thompson Scenic Railway Company.

In 1883 he was exiled to the desert of Arizona owing to ill health, and on his return to the East in 1884, at New Orleans, he started the first switchback, and there evolved the fundamental idea upon which all his later inventions were subsequently based.

About the time of his first invention Coney Island was just springing into prominence as a center of amusement, and Mr. Thompson here installed the first switchboard railway in 1884.

<p>
Illness caused by overwork in building up the Eagle Knitting Company at Elkhart caused an enforced period of rest in Arizona, and it was there that he conceived a plan to introduce the outdoors to the American people.  He suffered then from insommnia, and was compelled by his medical advisor to walk until he dropped from exhaustion.  He overcame the illness and on his way north stopped at New Orleans.  There in 1883 he built his first "switchback."  The gravity theory which he evolved in this invention was the subject of considerable scientific discussion at that time.
<p>
He came to Coney island in 1884, obtained a concession and built his "switchback."  It proved a sensation and the following year he developed the scenic railway.  It was the signal for the roller coaster craze to sweep  the country and orders came in so rapidly from amusement park managers that he formed a construction company, retaining practically all of the stock, for handling the business on a large scale.

There was a tramp, it is said, a regular one, with bad eyes, back hair sticking out of 
his hat, and toes sticking out of his shoes, just like the rest.  He slunk along like one 
who preferred even to steal the air he breathed.  Nasty old tramp that he was!  But one 
day he had been hanging around a roller skating rink.  He had frequently seen the happy 
young ones sailing up and down the sidewalk upon their wheeled skates.  A thought struck 
Mr. Tramp.  If people could go skating in summer time, why couldn't they go sleigh-riding 
too?  He pondered on it a good many times, in his lazy way.  He quite wore the crown out 
of his greasy old hat rubbing his hair so that that the idea could get through it.  At 
last it worked out.  It took shape.  The result was this curious gravity railway that 
about equally scares and delights the Johns and Marys.  John feels a call to hold Mary 
fast in the thing, so she won't fall out, which makes it rather more popular than it 
would otherwise be.  This tramp was an uncommonly shrewd tramp.  He patented his plans 
and found somebody to back him with capital.  The idea took like wildfire.  Every country 
resort and every beer garden or Sunday picnic ground erected a roller coaster.  Everybody 
with whom his own dignity was not a primary consideration wanted to ride in it.  In less 
than no time Mr. Tramp was worth half a million.  He found himself a gentleman before he 
knew it.  Last I heard of him he was making the grand tour of Europe along with the other 
gentlemen.  I  hope the story is true.<p>

<h4 class="title">Thrills for Thousands<br>
Tempting Profits in Devising New Amusements
</h4>
The switchback furnishes another illustration of how to make money rapidly.  Invented 
about twenty years ago, it was first tried on the public at Coney Island, and it literally 
made that now famous American resort, and subsequently became "the rage" all over the civilized world.
<p>
As a money-drawer it has had few, if any, equals.  At Shanghai, for instance, a railway, 
after working only eleven days, paid all expenses, and it was possible, moreover, for the 
directors of the company to declare a dividend of 10 per cent., and carry $500 to the 
reserve fund.  The dividend was--allowing 308 working days to the year--at the rate of 
280 per cent. per annum, while the addition to the reserve fund was at the rate of 14,000 
per annum.
<p>
What the inventor of the switchback made out of it may be inferred from a single fact.  
Coming to this country, he sold his English rights alone for a million and a quarter.  His gains, in fact, amounted to millions!
<p>
The most recent thrill-producer of this kind--the scenic railway--bids fair to beat all records.  It was evolved a few years ago, in remarkable circumstances.
<p>
When the inventor of the switchback had made his millions out of it, he began speculating on the Stock Exchange, with the result that in fifteen weeks he lost the whole of his money.
<p>
But instead of resolving to die, he at once set to work to make some more, and the upshot was the scenic railway, which is, after all, only an improved switchback. At once the invention "caught on," and ever since it has been a fine money-drawer.
<p>
Two or three months ago a company which then owned seventy-three scenic railways in America refused an offer of eight millions for its rights.
<p>
The scenic railway at the White City paid the whole cost of its construction in the first two months it was working.

about 75 feet across, tilted up on one side about 15 feet.  The rolling stock consisted 
of one park bench with four flanged wheels on it.  You got on at the top, was pushed off 
and came around to near the starting point.  The car was then pushed up to the starting 
point.
