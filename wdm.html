<h1>Wild Mouse Rides:  Early History in North America</h1>

This page attempts to track the earlier generation of wild mouse rides popular in North America in the 1950s and 1960s.  It is limited by its reliance on U.S. sources, particularly the Outdoor and Show News sections of Billboard magazine from 1954-1960.  This is very much a work in progress.  I have not yet had access to early issues of Amusement Business, which succeeded Funspot and the Show News section of Billboard in 1961.  I welcome additions and corrections, and am particularly interested in any information that sheds light on the European side of the business.

<P>The European history of the wild mouse is confusing and somewhat unclear.  The first ride of this sort was built by the German Showman Heinrich and was called Teufelskutsche (Devil's Coach).  Some sources date this ride to 1934, but the ride appears to have achieved its greatest popularity in the 1950s.  Pinfari's first roller coaster, dating from 1954, was a wild mouse-type ride.  Mack also claims to have developed the wild mouse.  One of their brochures states:

<div class="blockquote">
<P>In 1957 Mack built the first and original "Wild Mouse".  The coaster was completely made out of wood and installed in Canada.  
</div>

<P>However, since a Wild Mouse ride had already appeared at the Oktoberfest by 1955, this claim cannot be completely accurate. 

<P>In any case, the German ride seems to have captured the imagination of North American ride importers and manufacturers.  By the end of 1956, Patty Conklin had purchased a German Wild Mouse ride, and Ben Schiff had built a version.  Eric Wedemeyer was arranging to import the German ride, and Joe McKee was designing a stationary version of the ride.  For the next few years, wild mouse rides seem to have been among the hottest items (aside from permanent coasters) at parks and fairs in North America. 

<h2>WILD MOUSE MAKERS AND IMPORTERS</h2>
<h3>German Manufacturers</h3>

<P>The biggest problem here is that the U.S. trade magazines do not identify the manufacturers of imported rides.  The information presented here is from a variety of sometimes contradictory sources.

<p>
Heinrich developed the ride and produced a number of units for sale or export.  Some of the North American rides have been attributed to Heinrich.  However, being primarily a showman, Heinrich had limited production capacity.  

<p>
Clones of the Heinrich ride were produced by Zierer, under agreement from Heinrich.  All but the first of the Conklin-imported rides were obtained from this source.  Reports about Zierer's previous involvement in roller coaster manufacture are somewhat contradictory.  

<p>
Heinrich Mack's brochures and web site indicate that they produced their first wild mouse in 1957, and that it was installed in Canada.  It is possible that their earliest wild mouse rides were produced solely for export.  

<p>
The cars for the Conklin-imported rides came from Jhle (Ihle) of Bruchsal.  The cars used on the Wild Mouse at Santa Cruz Beach and Boardwalk were purchased from Buchwald Gebr&uuml;der.  

<p>
It is possible that there may have been additional German manufacturers that were manufacturing or exporting wild mouse rides.  Anton Schwarzkopf built a roller coaster as early as 1957, but no evidence for construction of wild mouse rides has been found.  


<h3>Importers</h3>

<P><h4 class="head">Eric Wedemeyer, Inc.</h4>

<P>Amusement rides formed only a small part of Eric Wedemeyer's business, which included import and export of novelties and specialty gifts, as well as manufacturing (Simplex Tool and Die, Hamilton Art Metal, Hamilton Diecasting).  In the amusement field, Wedemeyer was prominent in the mid to late 1950s as the importer of Roto-Jets, Strato-Jets, and Satellite Jets, manufactured in Germany by the firm of Kaspar Klaus.  Wedemeyer claimed at the end of 1956 to have sold three German wild mouse rides to Palisades, Pontchartrain, and Whitney's Playland.  However, he also mentioned that the German manufacturer had limited production capacity, and stated that an arrangement had been made with the German maker to have Joseph McKee of Palisades duplicate the ride.  The rides erected at Palisades and Pontchartrain were constructed domestically, while Whitney's Playland later obtained a German ride from Export Sales.  The first Wedemeyer-imported Wild Mouse ride appears to have opened at Boblo Island during the 1957 season.  It appears likely that this ride was the first Mack Wild Mouse.  Wedemeyer advertised Wild Mouse rides from 1956 until at least the end of 1957, and reported two additional sales in 1958.  However, it is not clear what parks bought these rides, and installation has not yet been confirmed.  By 1959, Wedemeyer's advertisements no longer mentioned Wild Mouse rides.  Wedemeyer stopped importing rides by early 1962.  

<P>The Wedemeyer ads in the spring of 1957 are for

<div class="blockquote">
<P>The Original "Wild Mouse"<br>
A new Serpentine Roller Coaster<br>
Built for us Exclusively by reliable German manufacturers.  <br>
We also undertake to construct this ride on inland locations with factory engineers under supervision of Mr. Joseph McKee, the famous Roller Coaster authority.
</div>

<P>By fall of 1957, the ads distinguish the

<div class="blockquote">
<P>Original Wilde Maus.  Made in Germany.  Portable. Sturdy and safe construction.  Laminated wooden track.  Preconvention showing, Boblo Park, Detroit.
</div>

<P>from the

<div class="blockquote">
<P>Devil's Coach.  A stationary version of the wild mouse.  Wooden superstructure built in U.S.A.  Laminated tracks.  Structural steel and streamlined, strapless cars made in Germany.
</div>

<P><h4 class="head">Hot Rods Inc.</h4>

<P>Morgan C. (Mickey) Hughes and John Christopher were partners in this firm from its founding in 1952 until Christopher's death in 1958.  The mainstay of this business in the 1950s consisted of Hot Rods cars imported from Germany.  The relationship of Hughes to the Conklin operation is unclear.  Many Hughes rides were showcased at the CNE, but since Conklin also imported rides, they may have simultaneously been competitors.  

<P>In late 1955, Hughes observed a Wild Mouse ride in operation at the Oktoberfest.  He described it for his American audience as having similarities to both Coasters and Virginia Reels, and noted that the German name for the ride (Wilde Maus) came from the skittish movement of the cars.  Hughes claimed that he would have the ride on the Conklin midway at the CNE in 1956.  However, it appears that he was unable to obtain one this year.  

<P>Hughes advertised one or more Wild Mouse rides at least from mid 1958 to early 1960.  At the end of 1958, the ads were for 

<div class="blockquote">
<p>German Wild Mouse Cars <br>
German Wild Mouse--Only 2 More for 1959 Delivery 
</div>

<p>while in spring 1960, the ads indicated 

<div class="blockquote">
<p>Available 2 Original German Wild Mouse Rides<br>
Factory New &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; Immediate Delivery
</div>

<p>All examples of Wild Mouse installations cited by the Hot Rods ads during this period were rides imported by Conklin. 

<P><h4 class="head">J. W. (Patty) Conklin</h4>

<P>Conklin first announced the purchase of a German Wild Mouse ride in 1956.  This ride was made by Heinrich and was purchased at the Oktoberfest from the showman Willenberg.  It was claimed that this was one of only four such rides in existence at that time.  The ride first ran on the Conklin midway at the 1957 Canadian National Exhibition (CNE) in Toronto, and was moved to Belmont Park in Montreal the following year.  
<p>
Conklin purchased two more rides in early 1958, and at least five more in late 1958 or early 1959.  These were manufactured by Zierer.  Several were sold, several were used on Conklin midways at various locations, and two appear to have remained unsold at least until the end of 1959.  It seems likely that the two advertised for sale by Conklin (under the name Fun Cars Ltd.) were the same as the two rides being offered by Hughes/Hot Rods. In late 1958, Conklin advertised 

<div class="blockquote">
We will take orders for 2 Wild Mouse Rides manufactured in Germany.  Delivery can be guaranteed before May 1, 1959.  Portable Construction.  Simplified Erection.  Proven Results.  &nbsp; ...<br>
If anyone wants to build his own Wild Mouse, we will sell complete structural plans.  If desired, we can furnish the track and the cars, manufactured in Germany.
</div>

<p>Conklin has been credited with providing plans that were used by Wright to build the Wild Mouse at Blackpool Pleasure Beach in the United Kingdom.  Conklin also provided plans used for the Santa Cruz ride.    Both rides opened in 1958, and both exhibit significant differences from the original German rides.  The wooden track used on the UK rides has a slightly different construction from the original.  The Santa Cruz ride used a conventional German-style wooden track, but this was produced by Timber Structures in California.  The support structure was modified to meet local building codes.  Some photographs of the Santa Cruz ride show a support structure which is partly steel, apparently a later modification.  

<p>In late 1959, Conklin advertised

<div class="blockquote">
We can deliver two rides immediately!<br>
Don't confuse this ride with the other rides of a similar nature!  This is the ORIGINAL  ride built in Germany by an established manufacturer.  Engineered to proven trouble-free performance with Roller Coaster-type chain drive. 
</div>
<p>
At the end of 1960, Conklin indicated in a letter to Kennywood Park that two of the rides would be available for 1961. 

<P><h4 class="head">Export Sales Corporation, Dallas, Texas & Frankfurt, Germany</h4>

<P>This firm, headed by Mack Duce, began advertising wild mouse rides beginning in 1959:  

<div class="blockquote">
The Original "Wild Mouse"<br>
Built in Germany by the Finest Craftsmen.  No other 'Wild Mouse' Ride can equal the design, quality and workmanship. <br>
Immediate Delivery
</div>

Export Sales imported the Alpine Racer installed at Whitney's Playland in 1959.

<p>At the end of 1961, this firm was still advertising a  "German Wilde Maus."   One of these rides was installed at LeSourdsville Lake in 1961.  This ride was built by Heinrich.  

<h3>North American Manufacturers</h3>

<P><h4 class="head">Joseph McKee</h4>

<P>Superintendent of Palisades Park, McKee built the first permanent wooden-structured wild mouse there in 1957.  McKee may be responsible for the design of similar wooden wild mouse rides at a number of other locations, but details have been difficult to find.  The Palisades and Pontchartrain rides used German-made cars.  At the beginning of its opening season, the Palisades mouse used cars borrowed from the Conklin ride.  

<P><h4 class="head">B. A. Schiff &amp; Associates</h4>

<P>Ben Schiff of Miami, Florida, listed a Wild Mouse ride in Billboard's Spring 1956 ride survey and placed a ride in Roseland Park (NY) in mid-1956.  This ride would have been the first Wild Mouse of any sort to operate in North America.  It may have been removed after an ejection accident in September, 1956.  

Advertisements at the end of 1956 mentioned rides at Funland Park, Miami, Florida and Havana, Cuba.  

An estimated 20-30 rides were installed by 1960.  Some of these may have been sold through a subsidiary called  Amusement Industries Supply Corporation.  The earliest rides were not designed to be portable, and the installation for the 1957 Kentucky State Fair required two weeks.   
<p>
In early 1959, Schiff introduced a smaller portable version of the Wild Mouse.  Schiff may have stopped producing the larger version in the United States, but sold the manufacturing rights to Butlin in the UK.  

<P><h4 class="head">Carll &amp; Ramagosa</h4>

<P>In addition to their other business interests, the operators of Casino Arcade Park in Wildwood built rides, showcased them at their parks, and then sold them.  A wild mouse was installed at their new Sportland Pier in 1957.  This ride was initially themed as Up-'n-Atom.  The ride was relocated when the pier was expanded, and was later renamed Flying Tiger.  A second ride was sold to Pacific Ocean Park, where it was named Flying Fish.  The POP Flying Fish had a track structure that appears identical to that of the Schiff rides, although the Flying Fish-themed cars appear to be quite different.  

<P><h4 class="head">Miler Manufacturing</h4>

<P>Carl Miler (often mis-spelled as Miller, potentially causing confusion with a more famous roller coaster designer) appears to have built a few rides each year, booked them into fairs, and then sold them--three portable roller coasters were on the U. S. fair circuit in 1957.  Miler first offered a Wild Mouse ride at the end of 1957.  The first of these all-steel coasters was delivered to Royal American Shows in 1958.  It was designed, in collaboration with Carl Sedlmayr, Jr., to be easier erect than previous wild mouse rides.  Although an erection time of 6 hours was planned, the first set-up (in Saskatoon) required twice that.  This was reduced to 8-10 hours (in Regina, Saskatchewan) using a crew of 21.  To improve portability, Royal American modified the ride at the start of the 1959 season.  Miler produced at least three additional units.  

<P><h4 class="head">Allan Herschell Company</h4>

<P>The Herschell firm billed itself as the world's largest ride manufacturer.  The Mad Mouse appeared in 1958 (at the Alabama State Fair, with Olson Shows), and a scaled-down version lacking the initial hairpin turns, the Mite Mouse, appeared in mid-1959.  The Mite Mouse appears to have been targeted to kiddielands.  The Monster Mouse, an enlarged ride with large initial drops, was introduced in 1963.  This was sold both as a complete ride and as a modification package for the Mad Mouse.  The Mad Mouse appears to have displaced the Schiff rides on travelling fairs, probably because it was much easier to set up and tear down.  In 1960, Strates traveled with their own (Schiff) Wild Mouse, the Tinsley Mad Mouse, and the Dowis (Miler) Wild Mouse.  The Mad Mouse was set up at every location, while the other two rides alternated.  Herschell probably also had higher production capacity than Schiff or Miler, with a delivery schedule of about one ride every two weeks during the first half of 1959, later increased to one a week.  More than 30 Mad Mouse rides were sold by 1960, with about half placed in parks.  

<P><h4 class="head">Velare Brothers</h4>

<P>The originators of Sky Wheels and Space Wheels have been mentioned in connection with the alterations to the Wild Mouse at Blackpool Pleasure Beach that were made in the 1960s.  The top circuit preceding the switchbacks, containing a big drop and a shallower dip, was added at that time.  Apparently this change was inspired by a similar alteration of the Velare's wild mouse at Nu-Pike in Long Beach, CA (shown below).  There is no evidence that the Velare Brothers were involved in the initial construction of the Wild Mouse at Blackpool, which predated the arrival of a Wild Mouse ride at Nu-Pike.  

<p><h4 class="head">Princeton Machine</h4>

<p> Conklin contracted with Princeton Machine of Princeton, Ontario, to build a steel copy of the imported German rides.  The track for this ride was imported from Europe (probably the Netherlands or Belgium).  Only one unit was produced, as this design appears not to have been particularly successful.  The ride was built around 1967.  This may have been the ride later installed at Playland in Vancouver.    

<p><h4 class="head">Tom Hughes</h4>

<p>No information except for an ad in 1958 offering complete plans for anybody wishing to build their own wild mouse.  The home address was in Hollywood, CA.

<P><h4 class="head">unknown</h4>
<p>
There are pictures of one or more units of a portable steel wild mouse differing from all others described.  The best documented example ended its working life at Old Indiana Park. Although the ride used the decorative entrance and exit gates of a Schiff ride, support structure differed considerably from that of the Schiff rides.  The track resembled that of the Schiff rides, but lacked the central pair of guide rails.  The cars somewhat resembled those of the portable Miler rides, using a tire as a rear bumper.  

<p>
A possibly similar ride first appeared on Royal American Shows around 1970.  

<h2>SOME MECHANICAL DETAILS OF WILD MOUSE RIDES</h2>

<P>The structure of the track on the 1954 Pinfari ride is not clear in the photo on their web site.  

<P>The earliest German wild mouse rides had laminated wooden rails.  In addition to the road rails, a central pair of metal guide rails was attached to the straight cross-ties.  This arrangement is shown in panel 1 below.  This structure was also used on the permanently installed wooden wild mouse rides.  The wild mouse rides in the UK use a similar track structure, except that the ends of the cross-ties are visible below the laminations of the wooden rails.  

<P>The Schiff and Ramagosa rides have a steel track with a distinctly different structure.  The road rails and the paired central guide rails are attached to U-shaped cross ties.  Compared to more modern track structures, the track appears impossibly flimsy.  This structure is shown in panel 2.  

<P>The Herschell Mad Mouse coasters have a more conventional style of non-tubular steel coaster track, with straight cross-ties and no separate guide rails.  The track structure is identical to that used on the Herschell kiddie coasters.  In fact, the Herschell ads for their 1960 portable roller coasters claim that they have Mad Mouse-style undercarriages.  This track structure is shown in panel 3.  

<P>Miler Wild Mouse rides have a distinctive four-rail track with diagonal bracing and H-shaped cross-ties (panel 4).  This is almost entirely unlike the structure of track used on most Miler kiddie coasters. Like the Herschell Mad Mouse, there are no central guide rails.  
<p>
Some of the later rides may have had steel rails.  The Wild Mouse at Playland in Vancouver had steel rails that were very similar to those shown in panel 1.  
<p>
Another variation in steel track structure was found on the Wild Mouse at Boblo Island in 1974 (panel 5).  This retains the central guide rails, but replaces the rectangular running rails with rails formed from I-shaped stock.  A similar structure was used on portions of the Devil's Coach in Guerneville, CA.  In both cases, these appear to be later modifications to rides which originally had laminated wooden rails, as only portions of the track were steel.  
<p>
Although not a wild mouse, but an enclosed coaster, the Wizard's Cavern ride located at Casino Pier,  Seaside Heights, NJ utilizes a similar car and track structure.  The ride was originally built by Mack in 1959 (as Broadway Trip) and utilized the standard wooden wild mouse track.  When this was rebuilt and rethemed by Mack in 1968 (as Love Bugs), the original track was replaced with a steel track having central guide rails.

<h2>NORTH-AMERICAN INSTALLATIONS OF WILD MOUSE RIDES</h2>

<P>These are grouped by type or manufacturer and ordered approximately by date of installation.  The distinction between portable and permanent wooden rides may not be meaningful.  The earliest German rides were both wooden-structured and designed to be portable, but when imported were generally set up as permanent installations.  The division of the wooden wild mouse rides into three lists largely reflects the incomplete state of the information about these rides.  The lists are extremely incomplete for any installations after 1960.  Modern Wild Mouse rides (those manufactured after 1980) are omitted entirely.  

<P>Dates in parentheses are from advance reports of sales or commitments and are unverified.  Note that these announced installations were sometimes delayed or cancelled.
