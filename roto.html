<h1>ROTO-JETS, STRATO-JETS, AND SATELLITE JETS</h1>

These rides were manufactured by the firm of Kaspar Klaus in Memmingen, Germany 
[<a href="#notes">see note 1</a>], and imported into the U.S. by Eric Wedemeyer.   

<p>
Klaus began producing Hurricane rides in 1951, with the initial unit being sold to the 
German showman Koch.  The fifth unit produced (in 1952) was brought into the U.S. and 
exhibited under the name Roto-Jet at Coney Island (NY) and several fairs in 1953 .  The 
first permanent installation in the U.S. was at Palisades in 1954.  Several rides were 
sold at the end of 1954, and in 1955, the new Roto-Jet was a big hit at Rye Playland.  
In all, one used ride and twenty new rides were imported from 1953 to 1957.  

<p>
The Roto Jets/Hurricane may have been a copy of an earlier ride.  Essentially identical 
rides (except for the decorative tower) appear to have been produced by Romolo Fabbri in 
Italy around 1950 and by George Maxwell &amp; Sons in the UK in 1952.  No patent 
corresponding to this ride has been found.
<p>

Klaus produced several units of a lifting version [Vampir] beginning at the end of 1953.  
In addition to the rider-controlled elevation of the sweeps, the carrier for the sweeps 
is raised once the ride is in motion.  One was imported by Wedemeyer and installed at 
Disneyland in 1956 (Astro-Jets) 
[<a href="#notes">see Note 2</a>].  Wedemeyer advertised these rides for the 1957 season 
under the name Strato-Jets.  Four units were imported in 1956-1957.  

<p>
An improved lifting version of the ride was introduced by Klaus in 1957 [Titan] and 
imported by Wedemeyer under the name Satellite Jet.  In this version of the ride, the 
mechanism that elevates the sweeps carrier also tilts the entire tower.  A ride of this 
type was found at Whalom Park until recently.  The Satellite at Lakeside Park is another 
example, but the tilting mechanism no longer operates.  Eight Satellite Jets were imported 
from 1957-1959.  

<p>
The Satellite Jet/Titan is described by Mathias Haug's patent
<A href="https://ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadPdf/2983509" target="_blank" rel="noreferencer">US 2983509</A> 
(assigned to Kaspar Klaus).  
This patent was filed in 1957 and issued in 1961, and cites a German patent application 
dated 1956. 
 
<p>
Further improvements and variations were produced by the Klaus firm, including the 
Hurricane X (1963) and Mirage (1966).  However, Wedemeyer's firm had ceased importing 
rides, and it does not appear that any of these reached the U.S.  

<p>
Haug's patent <A href="https://ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadPdf/3104103" target="_blank" rel="noreferencer">US 3104103</A> 
describes an improvement and simplification in which the carrier for the sweeps tilts, 
but not the tower.  In one embodiment, the tower and the orientation of the tilted axis 
are stationary, while in another embodiment, the tower and tilted axis rotate 
independently of the main sweep rotation (but at lower speed).  This patent was issued 
in 1963, with both the U.S. and German applications dated 1959.
