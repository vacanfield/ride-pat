<h1>About this site</h1>
<h2>General</h2>

<p>This site began in 2001 with a compilation of roller coaster patents and an essay on 
the early history of roller coasters as deduced from those patents.  Pages with patents for other rides 
were added later that year.  Also added in 2001 were pages covering early wild mouse coasters and several
other rides, with information largely derived from issues of Billboad published between 
1948 and 1960. 

<p><B>Important update (2025): </B>Direct links to US patent pdfs are no longer working.  
It is currently necessary to enter the patent number (left padded with 0s if shorter than 7 digits)
into one of the patent search pages.

<p>Subsequent changes were largely revisions, updates, and minor improvements.  Beginning in 
2007, several pages with information from digitized newspapers were added.  These 
were subsequently expanded as more material became available.

<p>Few updates have been made since mid-2015.  The site has been offline since my 
retirement in 2023, and is now being rehosted using GitHub Pages.  Few changes to content have 
been made, but broken links have been fixed or removed, and the site has been modernized 
to html5.  

<p> My general approach has been to attempt to provide information not otherwise 
available online.  In the years since this content was first uploaded, the proliferation of 
online sources has led to an abundance of information that, in some cases, has 
superceded my pages.  In a few cases I have corrected errors, or removed pages as no 
longer relevant, but I have more often left the content unchanged.

<h2>Patents</h2>  
<P>I have attempted to include every U.S. patent related to roller coasters, although 
updates ceased in 2015. The main 
table on the roller coaster patent page contains more than 470 patents for roller coasters 
and their appliances, as well as some patents for rides (and other things) that are not 
strictly roller coasters, but appear to be relevant to their development. Zip lines and 
backyard coasters are located in separate tables.

<P>Numerous additional ride patents are placed in tables distributed across several additional pages.  
I have ignored those that consist of bicycle tracks, playground-size or rider-propelled 
rides (except a few typically located in amusement parks), and miniature models or toys. 
Even with these omissions, the site has grown to more than 2600 patents.  My knowledge of 
many of these rides is limited, and in many cases, patents have not been identified with 
their standard or trade names. Since it was not always possible from a cursory 
examination to detrmine whether a ride was powered or not, it is possible that some 
patents are placed incorrectly or inconsistently in these tables. 

<P>Access on the USPTO site to patents older than 1976 is strictly by patent number, date 
of issue, and classification.  There is at this time (2024) no online index by title or 
inventor for older patents.  It is possible to search using 
<a href="https://patents.google.com">Google Patents</a>, with the usual caveats about 
reliability of the text conversions. Many US patents can also be searched via the 
<a href="https://worldwide.espacenet.com">European Patent Office search site</a>.  
Some patents are present but lack the associated bibliographic information, and can be 
found in this resource only by patent number.  

<p>In addition to issued patents, I have included published patent applications in the 
tables.  Since the end of 2000, most US patent appliations are published 18 months after 
their priority dates.  The patent application table include only applications for which 
patents had not yet been issued at the time of compilation.

<p>For US patents and patent applications, static urls included in the tables formerly (2024) linked to pdf 
versions of the publications.  For patents issued since 1976, full text versions are also 
accessible.  It is now necessary to search by patent number using the 
<a href="https://ppubs.uspto.gov/pubwebapp/static/pages/ppubsbasic.html">USPTO basic search</a> page.
Searches can also be conducted using the
<a href="https://ppubs.uspto.gov/pubwebapp/">USPTO advanced search</a> page.

<P>There are a number of examples of technology for which I have not found patents, such 
as rail-bending machinery and the track systems used for older Wild Mouse rides, 
Schwarzkopf Wildcats, and Pinfari Zyklons. Patents whose utility is not restricted to 
rides are likely to have eluded my search. Some advances may have been patented only in 
other countries or not at all. Joseph McKee of Palisades Park, for example, has been 
credited with making improvements in roller coaster technology which he never sought 
to patent. 
<p>
I have listed patents with their date of issue.  Filing dates, which are a more reliable 
guide to the date of invention, can be found by examining the published patents.  

<h2>Acknowledgments</h2>

Numerous people have provided information that was useful for assembling this site.  
I have tried to list them on the <A href="ack.html">Acknowledgments page</A>.  Special 
thanks are due to Jeff Stanton for finding numerous patents that I have overlooked in my 
searches.  

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>

This entire site should be considered a work in progress.  My sources are not always 
accurate or complete.  My interpretations and extrapolations may be invalid.  I regard 
my conclusions in many cases as provisional.  Errors are subject to correction without 
notice.
