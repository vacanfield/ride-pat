Grand Improvements for 1872.</h4>
...<br>
An Elevated Railway.<br>
Of all the other novelties at Rocky Point this season, the elevated railway will doubtless be the most popular.  It is located just west of the buildings just described, between that and the Rock House.  Two tracks are laid, each upwards of four hundred feet in length, and a person can make the round trip for the low price of ten cents, the cars running every few minutes.  The modus operandi is as follows.  You walk up to the passenger station, purchase your ticket, enter the station and take a seat in the handsome car with nine others, if there are that number waiting for a ride.  The car is started off by a gentle push, and down it goes the inclined plane, four hundred feet, where it is switched off and comes back upon another track to the other side of the building, where the passengers alight.  The ride is one of the most agreeable that can possibly be imagined, and perfectly safe, there being not the least possible chance for an accident.  There is not only no unpleasant sensation, but in a hot summer day, one would find it exceedingly refreshing.  A picket fence runs on each side of the track to keep outsiders from getting in.  One of these railways was run at Holly Grove in Baltimore last summer 
by Mr. J. G. Taylor, the patentee, and over 100,000 people rode on it.  The American Steamboat Company have bought the right to use it in Rhode Island.  ...

The Tri-State fair at Toledo was attended by a few of the people of Butler.  The roller coaster was the chief attraction at the fair.  This is a small improvement on the old time sport of riding down hill, and trudging up the best way you can.  It consists of a railing on a circular incline plane, upon which a long bench like car is placed, and being filled with fifteen or twenty persons is pushed off and it makes the circuit of 600 feet in about twelve seconds attaining a speed of more than a mile a minute.

<h4 class="title">The New Amusement--The Roller Coaster--The Cutest Notion and the Greatest Success of the Century.</h4>
Several years ago, Mr. Alanson Wood, a mechanic and contractor of Toledo, O., conceived the idea of an appliance for coasting, or as the boys used to call it, "Ridin' down hill," in the Summer time, when snow is not available.<p>
Everybody remembers the old pastime of riding down hill.  Everybody remembers the delight of his sled, the sharp steel-shod sled on which he cast himself recklessly on the top of a high hill, ling flat upon his abdomen, steering the vehicle with his toes, and the exhilerating slide down the long steep hill, the track as smooth as glass.  Likewise does everybody remember the double sled which would carry two, the boy and his favorite girl, of the rush down the hill so rapid that even to kiss the girl in transit was impossible. <p>
There was nothing in life so exciting as riding down hill.  There's the snow, the sled, steel-shod, made as light as consistent with strength and stanchness.  There was the start, the slow motion to being with, the rapid flight as the descent became more acute and the law of gravity began to assert itself, there was the anxious look behind for the rival sled, for boys were as proud of their sleds as men now are as to the speed of trotting horses, there was the urging with the toe, for as fast as it was going it could be made by management to go faster, there was the lightning-like descent, the skill in steering so as to keep as near the inside of a curve as possible and lose no inch of length unnecessarily, and when the bottom of the hill was reached and the road stretched off into a long level, there was the anxiety as to how far out upon this level the momentum would carry it.  There were great differences in sleds.  One sled would make better time down the hill, while another would carry, as you may say, rods farther than the faster one. <p>
The writer hereof, in good old Cortland County, N. Y., was wont, in his boyhood, to enjoy a ride down a straight hill, two and a half miles from top to bottom, with a good half mile of level road at the finish.  Clad in sheep's grey, with well tallowed boots, that two miles and a half up-hill was cheerfully walked many a time in the cold, bright moonlight for the sake of the bird-like flight downward.  It was this exercise which enabled him in after years to bear the wear and tear of newspaper life, probably. <p>
This was great fun, but it had its drawbacks.  The slide down the hill was delightful, but to repeat you must needs walk up the hill again, and it was a question, a very serious one, whether the fun of gliding down the hill compensated for the walking back.  As it was rather trying on the stout and stubbed boy, what must it have been for the girl?  Her liking for the boy was all that sustained her. <p>
Another drawback to this amusement was, it could only be indulged in when there was snow on the ground, and that in right quantities and conditions. <p>
Mr. Wood, who evidently had been fond of "sliding down hill" when a boy, conceived the idea of making the amusement possible at all times of the year, and of doing away with the tedious dragging one's self up the hill after the exhilerating ride down.  It was a very simple thing to conceive, but a very difficult thing to carry out.  But he did it.  <p>
First, he substituted wheels for runners, and a railroad track for snow.  Then he made a car that would hold as many as might be desirable, up to 20, say, with comfortable seats, and under the carriage body he put two trucks, the wheels being flanged the same as railroad wheels.  He built a track, 500 feet in length, both ends of which were elevated 21 feet, and he made the descent very rapid for about 200 feet, the grade growing less and less, till finally it became level, then a gradual ascent till it struck the rising grade of the other end, where it was, as at the beginning, 21 feet high. <p>
Now a car running down a grade 21 feet, will, by its own momentum, rise at the other end 17 feet, and were the car loaded and ran down the 21 foot grade it would stop when within 17 feet of the other end, and run back, and then back again, losing a few feet each time, till it would finally stop at the lowest point on the level.  Mr. Wood provided for that by putting a man 17 feet from the end, who, when the car reaches that point, gently shoves it up the level summit, and then runs it back again, to be caught in the same way at the other end. <p>
For this ride the proprietor of the Roller Coaster charges a small fee, say two for five cents, or whatever his love of money and the temper of the public will stand. <p>
The Roller Coaster has been the greatest success in the way of amusement that has been before the American public for years.  Physicians recommend it as an exhilerant and invigorant, as the following testimonial from the most eminent physicians of Toledo testifies:<p>
Toledo, O., Sept.--1883.<br>
From personal experience and observation we recommend the use of the Roller Coaster, for a large class of invalids, not only as a means of giving a healthful and agreeable recreation, but as furnishing one of the best means of diverting the attention of the individual from morbid feelings and gloomy thoughts.<br>

D. P. Chamberlin, M. D. <br>
W. C. Chapman, M. D. <br>
C. L. Van Pelt, M. D. <br>
J. W. Bond, M. D. <br>
S. F. Forbes, M. D.<p>
Children flock to it by the thousand, and grave men and women renew the amusements of their youth on the rapid car. <p>
It is absolutely safe, no accident can occur, it is very cheap amusement and yet it aggregates very largely for the proprietors.  One has been in operation in Toledo all the last Summer and the daily receipts have never been less than from $25 to $100 a day, and during three days of the Tri-State Fair, the enormous sum, for such a business, of $1,200 was realized.  Enclosed, it will be in operation all Winter, and will be the merriest place in the City. <p>
Mr. Wood, the inventor and patentee, has given the matter much time, he has worked out the idea faithfully, and has made a complete success of it.  We are glad to know that he is realizing all he desires for his invention.  The territory for the country is being very rapidly taken, for there has been nothing brought before the public so easily managed that brings such certain results.  The right to the Roller Coaster for one Ward in Chicago sold for $1,000, and the same price was obtained for one Ward in St. Louis.  From every part of the country enquiries are coming in to him and his partners by the thousands. <p>
It is one of those lucky thoughts well worked out and taken hold of boldly that make men's fortunes. <p>
It affords a cheap pleasure, healthful amusement, not only to grown children but those of larger growth.  It is not a mere ephemeral thing, as are so many novelties, as boys and men indulge in coasting on snow now the same as they did an hundred years ago, so the roller-coaster has for its best patrons to-day those who were first to try it.  It grows by usage. <p>
The time is very close at hand when it will be in use in every County in the United States, and every Village will have its roller-coaster. <p>
J. A. Cahoon, Toledo, O., will answer all letters of inquiry concerning the new roller-coaster.  He desires correspondence from at least one good man in every County in the United States.

<h4 class="title">Roller Coasting<br>
A New South Side Amusement</h4>
A curious structure is now in the course of construction on the large vacant lot at the southwest corner of State and Twenty-second streets.  It will be known as "The Roller Coaster," and the objects claimed for it are health and amusement.  The erection is composed almost entirely of lumber, and is built on trestles rising from the ground to a height of twenty-two feet.  It is circular in form, the diameter being 140 feet, and the circumference about 430 feet.  The width of the track is about 2 feet, on which are lines of iron rails on which six cars will run in sections of two each.  They will start from the highest point of the track, and running down will be impelled by their own weight, reaching a velocity that will bring them up the incline to a large platform in the space of eighteen seconds.  The sides of the track have enclosed balustrades, as a protection against the cars running off.  The charge will be five cents for riding round the circle three times.  Each car will accommodate from six to nine persons.  The highest point of the "coaster" faces State street, and a flight of stairs from the sidewalk of that thoroughfare will take the public to the platform, where another flight will bring them to the cars.  The platform, which is thirteen feet from the level, will have a seating capacity for about 200 persons.  The structure is being built by P. M. Stevenson, of Toledo, O., who has already erected two "coasters" in that city, and is going to put up another at New Orleans forthwith.  The cost is about $800, and Mr. E. C. Hudson, of Toledo, O., is the manager of them.  It is said to be a most exhilarating amusement to ride in one of these cars, and the effect is so exciting and pleasurable that the rider fairly loses himself, forgetting even who he is, where he lives, or what he is doing.  The first "coaster" erected was simply an experiment, but instantly proved a great success.  The work was begun the 18th inst., and it is expected that the "coaster" will be in complete running order by next Wednesday.

<h4 class="title">Give the Children a Chance.</h4>
There have been some complaints against the noise occasioned by the running of the roller coasters.  It does not seem to be sufficiently annoying to justify the abolition of this innocent form of amusement.  Of course where children play and have fun, shouts and laughter will necessarily supervene; but why not bear with them since they are having such a good time?  To rob them of this chance for healthful exercise would be almost cruel.  Beside they only wake the echoes in a pleasant way, and after 10 o'clock are off to bed.  The roller coaster creates no more disturbance than the city cars on St. Charles Avenue, and runs only about four hours every evening.  The residents in that vicinity are asked to reconsider their supposed grievance and let the children have their fun.

<h4 class="title">The Cotton Centennial.</h4>
This is a place that is never at a loss for amusements, and some enterprising pauper has hit upon a scheme for turning honest pennies and affording people amusement.  He has erected in a large lot, on St. Charles avenue, an affair which is termed a roller coaster.  It is a wooden structure, and has a track resembling an elevated railroad with the exception that the track curves downward and then sharply upward every few feet.  The cars are on wheels and run with amazing rapidity.  The principle is that of some physical force, the car is attracted by gravity downward and acquires a certain velocity in descending the steep declivity, and the acquired velocity carries it up on the other side.  The trip has a little tinge of danger in it that renders the pleasure very doubtful, and when the feat has become un fair accompli your first feeling is that of intense relief.  It has become quite the fashion to make up parties and spend the warm evenings in this manner, but I think that every one enters into the unusual sport with a little uneasiness and are so very much intimidated after their first ride that they can not be induced to attempt it again.  To children, and especially boys, it possesses great attractions, and from them it receives the great part of the patronage bestowed upon it.  As they shoot down the steep inclines they are all fired with an overpowering desire to shriek, and give vent to it simultaneously, making the place reverberate with their screams.  When several have been seriously inured there will be some authoritative stop put to it, I suppose.

<h4 class="title">A Lonely Man at the Great Show </h4>
[New Orleans Cor. New York Sun.]<p>
Among the saddest looking men in New Orleans is one who wears a blonde beard and an air of rebellious dejection as he goes scooping with interminable rattle and roar over the track of his own roller coaster. The enterprise at this writing is not a popular success. The track pursues its devious way on a circular series of stilts set in a marshy bit of ground near one of the entrances to the exposition. It is precisely similar to the coasters at Coney Island, but it is regarded here by visitors as something coarse, improper and uninteresting.  Although huge placards inform the public that two rides can be enjoyed for the small sum of 5 cents, it would appear that the solitary man with the blonde beard is doomed to go tearing around on the track with never a soul for company for the rest of his stay.  Natty visitors from the north pass the familiar structure with out a glance, loudly dressed men and women from the upper inland cities look at it uninterestedly, and southern observers see nothing in its din and uproar to attract.
<p>
At two minute intervals during the day the solemn man steps upon the car and pushes her off.  He has traveled the route so much that the steep descents and sudden swerves have no effect whatever on his equilibrium, and he goes banging, bouncing, and rattling along with unrudied mien.  If he happens to be paring his nails or reading a newspaper he goes right on with the occupation while the car is careening wildly about.  He never smiles, but all day long through weather that is dismal or damp, as the case may be, he goes on his lonely way.

The roller coasting at the springs is, no doubt, very enjoyable and great fun for the young people, but to lookers on it sometimes has a dangerous look.  By the sometimes we mean when more children are allowed to ride on the coaster than should be allowed; some day when the little ones are in the heighth of enjoyment, two or three will be flung out, dashed to the ground and get their necks broken.  The proprietor of the coaster should guard against this, either by limiting the number of children riding together at one time, or fixing a board in front, so they cannot be thrown out.

We have something new and very novel in its sensations here in the way of a roller coaster, which I hardly know how to describe. There is a circle 550 feet around, its highest point being 25 feet from the ground, which is also its starting point.  Around this circle is a tram car track, upon which run two benches or seats on small car wheels, which comfortably seat twenty persons.  You start down a gentle incline getting steeper and steeper until the climax is reached, when you find yourself at the bottom and like fury ascending the up grade within 50 feet of the starting point, and the distance of 500 feet is made in 14 seconds, without any danger of any kind but losing your hat or breath, and the way the little ones, aye, and the large ones too, enjoy it is pleasant to behold.

M. to 9 P. M., or any other hours after church services, on that day the council may consent to.  The roller coaster is a very simple method of amusement, from which persons of all ages derive benefit and enjoyment, and cannot fail to be indorsed by the people here, as has so heartly been by those of New Orleans, La., Jacksonville, Fa., Nashville, Tenn., and Toledo, O., and now also in course of erection at Cincinnati, O."--Memphis Avalanche.

Phenomenal Success of the New Device at the Highland House.</h4>
The attendance at the Highland House yesterday afternoon and evening was enormous.  Currier's Band had full houses all day, and the platforms were at all times crowded.  The "roller-coaster," which Little Giant [George B.] Kerper can hear thunder by his office-window every thirty seconds when the rush is on, makes music to his ears because it indicates that about eighty cents a minute are flowing into the exchequer of the little firm, of which he is one-half, and which is the fortunate owner of the exclusive right to use the coaster in this country for fifteen years--a right for which they paid only $6,000.  Though nearly ten thousand rides have been taken on the coaster every Sunday and holiday, and from one to three thousand on each ordinary day, there seems no abatement of its popularity.  The number of tickets sold and rides taken does not, of course, indicate the number of people who have enjoyed the novel and decided sensation, as many ride over and over again, getting "stuck on it," but it is safe to say that nearly a hundred thousand have, and the cry is, "still they come."

Young ladies shout with delight as the coaster plunges around the course, and it is about as great a pleasure to watch them as to ride.

A ride on the coaster was proposed, and the party shortly after 10 o'clock seated themselves on the coaster and were whirled around the track.

Reinfleisch is twenty four years of age and single.  His friends who were with him in the car when the accident occurred say that all were standing up, he on the rear end, and the swing in going around the last curve threw him off balance, falling against the trestlework and to the ground near Mr. Kerper's office.

But come here.  This is the newest thing.  The roller coaster.  The Russian ice hills made circular and traversed by a car instead of sleds.  Thirty feet up these stairs.  A car with two settees end to end; sixteen of us sit down, one hand on hat, the other clinging to the seat.  Take a long breath and hold on to it.  Here we go, plunge No. 1.  Now we are on the edge of the rock.  Down the second incline with a roar.  Railroad speed?  That's nothing.  No time to think.  Plunge No. 3.  Whew!  The hair [?].  Here we are back again in just sixteen seconds.  You let go the breath you have been holding and jump up, glad to be on a slower machine.  "Try another round?" "No, thank you." "Didn't you like it?" "Oh, yes; but I've no farther use for it."

Edward Reinfleisch, single, aged twenty-four years, received what may prove fatal injuries, by being thrown from the roller coaster at the Highland House, Cincinnati, a few nights ago.  Reinfleisch, with a number of friends was seated on the coaster and were whirled around the track.  The coaster went gliding down the first incline all right, but while passing the dip on the last round he was thrown violently from the coaster against the building.  He was picked up in an insensible condition and upon examination was found to be injured internally.

The velocity attained by the Bellevue roller coaster would distance Maud 8 in the first heat, and goes twice as fast at Ten Broeck's best time, and no locomotive has yet been built that travels as fast as this, viz:  running at the rate of a mile inside of forty-eight seconds.  The varied attractions offered at the Bellevue surpass all other hill-top resorts.  The roller coaster is a most healthful recreation.

A frightful accident, whereby a twelve year-old girl may lose her life, occurred at the Bellevue House about 6:30 o'clock last evening.  Ida Hehepohn, of No. 17 Jones street, while playing with other children in the vicinity of the roller-coaster, unthinkingly climbed to the track at a point close to the ground, and consequently just behind a declivity by the rapid descent of which the car is impelled on its way.  Not noticing the car or truck being started, the unfortunate child remained unconscious of her danger until struck by the rapidly moving coaster.  She was knocked down, but strange to say was not killed out-right.  She, however, sustained a fracture of the left arm above the elbow, and her lower limbs were badly cut and bruised.  She is also probably hurt internally.  After receiving the best possible attention on the premises, the injured child was taken to her home.

<h4 class="title">Witnesses Broken Down.<br>
They Could Not Describe the Fearful Noise of the "Roller Coaster."</h4>
Now that a "roller coaster" is ready to be launched upon the local public at Savin Rock, it is interesting to learn from the Boston Herald that Judge Buchwalter of Cincinnati, has been occupied an entire day with the hearing of testimony in a complaint case against one of them.  Henry A. Morill and a number of other property owners and residents in the vicinity of the Bellevue house, in Cincinnati, are the plaintiffs, and David Billigheimer the defendant.  The plaintiffs allege that the "roller coaster" or circular gravity railway, recently constructed on the Bellevue house grounds, is a nuisance to the neighborhood, on account of the noise it produces; that it prevents sleep, tortures invalids and nervous people, interrupts conversations, and will depreciate the value of property in that vicinity unless its further operation is enjoined, which the plaintiffs pray the court may be done by a perpetual injunction.
<p>
Mr. Billigheimer admits the presence of a roller coaster on the Bellevue grounds.  It was constructed at an expense of $4,000 and can be used for no other purpose than that to which it is now applied.  It furnishes innocent amusement to a large number of people, and the small fare which is charged is an important source of revenue to him.  He alleges that while the track was being constructed some of the plaintiffs talked with him in regard to it, and they all knew what was being erected, but no complaint or protest was made.  
<p>
The testimony was entertaining.  Counsel for the defense tried to keep out statements by the witnesses as to the effect of the noise upon them, but were unsuccessful.  The witnesses all broke down in trying to describe the noise of the coaster--it was so unlike any other noise, and strong words were needed to do it justice.  With the starting of the car, which at times is every few minutes, there is a loud noise from the friction of the wheels upon the rails, which grows rapidly louder as the car descends, and is reinforced by the screaming of the excited passengers.  It was the experience of the witnesses that babies are woke up by the noise, all conversation has to be stopped for the moment, people who are reading or otherwise engaged have their attention diverted, the sick and nervous people are greatly annoyed, and distressing fear is continually excited by the screaming of the passengers that the car has left the track and people are being dreadfully hurt.

What Our Cincinnati Correspondent Has to Tell This Week.</h4>
A curious and interesting case is on hearing in the courts here, in which is involved the question of what constitutes a nuisance.  On the hill-top resort at the Bellevue house the proprietor has put up a roller-coaster, in which passengers are wheeled over a tramway in a roller car at a breath-taking speed.  Citizens living on Ohio avenue, near which the coaster has been erected, have applied to the courts to have it abated as a nuisance.  The testimony of the plaintiffs has been voluminous.  Most of the witnesses are refined women.  Their evidence was that the noise was shocking, and that the screams of the women passengers were constantly suggestive of people suffering great bodily pain or mental anguish. It was in evidence, too, that it was generally harrowing to the nerves and distracting to the mind, and that it greatly interfered with ordinary conversation, and that it waked up and scared babies and prevented grown people from sleeping.  On the other hand, it was in evidence that, "yes, the thing does make a noise, to be sure, but then it doesn't disturb us a bit." Counsel for the plaintiffs shadow forth along through the proceeding that their argument will be that neighbors are entitled to protection against a nuisance which is not more than counterbalanced by a compensation in the way of a benefit to the general public.  Able counsel are employed on both sides, and they fight the case vigorously.

One of the queerest of these that the island has yet seen was put in operation yesterday.  It is a sort of summer coasting hill, except the "hill" is a wooden trough about three feet wide, which forms a circular incline whose circumference is about the extent of two city blocks. Benches on runners fit into a narrow track in this trough, and a half a dozen people seated on one of these benches are whirled around this track at a frightful rate of speed. This new "game" only opened at two o'clock in the afternoon, and by six o'clock, at the moderate rate of five cents for a whirl, the proprietor must have realized about $200.  It was the prevailing impression among the onlookers that it was a question of but a very short time when somebody would be killed on the new-fangled amusement.

The proper method of experimenting with the slide is for the youth to take his girl into the car, which holds eight people, and is allowed to slide down the incline unassisted.  Its weight carries it up another incline, whence it is switched over to another track, and the occupants slide back again to the starting place.  It proved a very popular pastime, and all afternoon groups of young people were clamoring for an opportunity to get into the car.

A new amusement this season in the coasting railway.  An elevated circular track has been built on posts.  One side of the circle is on a level with the ground, but the other side is about twenty feet above the ground.  Cars loaded with people start at the highest point, and roll at terrific speed down the incline, around the circle, and are carried by their impetus almost up the other side.  The speed is so great as to make one gasp for breath, and children and women often scream with terror.  Another elevated railroad, run on a similar plan but in a straight line, has hills which seem almost perpendicular in their descent to the helpless passengers in the car.  These railways were crowded all day, and the headlong speed and spice of danger seemed only to whet people's appetites for a ride, though few women cared to ride a second time.

<h4 class="title">A Legal Fight Over the Right to Build Coasters</h4>
For some days past there has been trouble brewing for those who have erected circular coasters on the Island.  The inventors and patentees have made their appearance on the Island and in the United States Courts, and the heretofore supposed royal road to the building of these popular means of amusement is threatened with legal obstructions.  These affairs were not thought of until Mr. Andrew D. Culver, who had seen them in New Orleans last winter, spoke of them.  They were being put up all over the South by the patentees, Wood &amp; Cahoon; but at Memphis they found their rights infringed, and applied to the courts for redress, which they got.  Then the Memphis parties went to Coney Island and put up one of the circular coasters near Mrs. Vanderveer's Bathing Pavilion. In the meantime Messrs. Wood &amp; Cahoon had contracted with the Prospect Park &amp; Coney Island Railroad for some of the latter's ground west of the new pier walk whereon to build a double-track coaster.  When they arrived at the Island they again found their rights infringed by the parties whom they had fought in the courts of Memphis.  Yesterday they applied to Judge Benedict for an injunction.  The decision is expected in a day or two. The double-track coaster, which is being erected on the Culver road property, will be in operation to-morrow.  It is being constructed by the inventor himself--Mr. Wood, of Toledo--and will be the only one ever seen in this part of the country with the proper "descents," ''waves" and "hills".  These features of a coaster are constructed on scientific principles, and cannot be appreciated by those who have used only those in operation at the Island so far this season.  In the centre of the circle will be built a free platform for those who desire to look on, and will be capable of seating 250 people.

This is the lately introduced invention which receives its name from the supposed resemblance it bears to a hand sled sliding down a hill.  It goes with the velocity of lightning up and down a series of inclined planes, and is the nearest approach to perpetual motion yet discovered.  Mr. Oelschmitt was fascinated by it and was soon sitting on the sled between two pretty girls.  As the machine ran down the steep incline with a whir, the gentleman from Trenton became alarmed at its great speed and sprang to his feet.  The pretty girls screamed with terror and the sled rocked from side to side.  Mr. Oelschmitt lost his balance and fell over the railing.  Fortunately, he landed in a pile of sand, and after being carried into Paul Bauer's he soon recovered...

<h4 class="title">Coasting At Coney Island<br>
A Tumultuous Experience For A Paltry Nickel.<br>
Cholly, Tessie, a Freckled Youth, a Fourth Ward Girl, and a Litterateur Make an Exciting Trip Together--All the Rage.</h4>
"Coasting" is the rage at Coney Island this season.  It is a noisy, tumultuous, head-long, and exciting sport, which requires neither skill nor muscle.  It can be enjoyed in all its intensity for five cents a "coaster."  At present there are five "runs" on the island--four at the west end and one alongside the Brighton Beach Hotel.  The noise of a coasting run is a sort of blending of the rattle and bang of the elevated railroad system, the clatter of a Broadway stage, the sough of a buffeted fog horn, and the ambitious efforts of a steel-lunged youth on a cracked clarinet.
<p>
The effects upon listeners is varied.  Small boys are unable to stand still when they first come near a coaster in full blast, and small girls cling to their mothers' skirts and yearn.  Lovers giggle and scream, and the proprietor of the coaster gathers in the five-cent pieces by the bushel.  To him the snort of the coaster is sweet and joyous music.
<p>
The first requisite for the construction of a coaster is a varied and unlimited supply of stilts.  The idea of the run was suggested by the immense structures at Montreal, where the Canadians go tobogganing.  A trestlework about fifteen feet high, four feet broad, and fifty feet long is erected.  It has a railroad on its upper surface.  On the two rails run the sledges, which are nothing more nor less than long benches on flanged wheels which fit the track.  The track is not level by any means.  It is, indeed, quite the reverse.  The sledge starts off an at altitude of fifteen or twenty feet, runs a few feet, and then starts on a down grade at the rate of about thirty-five miles an hour.  It runs down a short distance and then the track dips at a perceptible curve to the level of the earth, and rises in another curve nearly to the fifteen or twenty foot level again.  These curves in the track are something in the form of the letter S laid over on its front.  Such was the original coaster at Coney Island.  It reaped such a harvest that enterprise and capital began to erect rivals, and now the varieties in the forms of the coasters defy description.  Some of them are circular, and make three or four dips before the journey is finished, and a very large one, which has just been erected near the water's edge at West Brighton, has two tracks that run side by side and at devious angles, curves, dips, and courses to a common finish.  It is the custom here to start two cars off and once and watch the wild race.  The cars start off easily, loaded with Coney Island excursionists, and glide gently along for a few feet.  Then there is a yell as the car dips headlong on one of the curves and shoots almost vertically downward.  Its momentum carries it up the next incline; it dips again, and gathers enough velocity to carry it slowly up grade until it comes nearly to the station whence it started.  The noise is terrific.  
<p>
The first ride on a coaster is apt to prove a novelty to the youth or maiden who has become blas&eacute; in the matter of scups, and whose appetite for merry-go-rounds has become jaded by too frequent indulgence.  There are points about the ride that are unusual.  It combined the effect of seasickness, imparted by the primeval swing, with the rush of a runaway ice wagon on a down grade; but besides all this there is a feeling of sailing through space which is elsewhere unattainable without the assistance of a balloon.
<p>
The writer ascended a steep flight of steps to the platform of the coaster directly in front of Cable's yesterday afternoon.  He was moved thereto by a loud-voiced man, who wore a beaver hat very much over his left eye, and discoursed somewhat in the following strain:
<p>
"Five cents fur f'teen sickonds of dee-lee-tious joy, gents, is cheap to a paw-pur.  Take my advice, and as-cend to the sky fur a flight through the air fur five cents!"
<p>
At the top of the stairs was a rotund man, who smiled reassuringly over a barricade of nickels and dimes.
<p>
"There ain't a bit o' danger," he said, as though repeating a lesson, as he nonchalantly handed back the change., "the structure is safe--the trip refreshing--turn to your right--thanks."
<p>
There were four persons waiting for the car, which was run forward and placed in position by the attendants.  A small, freckled boy, with unnecessarily long legs and the usual lavish complement of feet, stood gazing down the precipitous run, while his companions, two young women and a young man, talked excitedly.  The young man wore a dainty, juvenile straw hat with a real nice blue ribbon, and low shoes, with polka-dot hose.  His attire was in the now familiar Coney Island swell fashion, and he smoked a big cigar.
<p>
"Dear me," he said, with excitement; "I'm sure I don't know what on earth will become of us if we go down that terrible place.  Ain't you afraid, Tessie?"
<p>
"Orful, Cholly," answered Tessie, whose jersey and white skirt made her look very much like three thousand other girls on the beach that day; "but I'm in fur it now, an' it all goes."
<p>
The other girl had appealing eyes, plump arms, and a trustful smile.  "I wonder will we be killed?" she murmured in the soft accent and quaint vernacular possessed only by hereditary Fourth warders.
<p>
The attendant pushed the car into place and hastily stowed the party in.  In this instance the car was an ordinary park bench on wheels, running lengthwise.  The passengers thus sailed with their right sides foremost.
<p>
"Cholly," who had become silent and over-awed, took his seat at the fore, with "Tessie" by his side.  She, too, dropped conventionality and clung to the left lapel of his coat, while the freckled boy grabbed Tessie with both arms.  The big-eyed girl sat next, with The Sun reporter on the tail end.  Both felt isolated.  Both were from New York.
<p>
The car started slowly, with a creak and a grind, and then rolled rapidly downward, emiting a sound like that of a steam stone crusher.  Then it tipped downward suddenly, and the freckled-face boy bounded into his sister's lap, while she seized her escort with a desperate grip.  The Fourth ward girl stretched out her hand to grasp the back of the seat.  So did the reporter.  Their hands met.  The girl gasped
<p>
"Axcuse---"
<p>
"Cert--"
<p>
Bang!  Down went the car, and the whole line shot forward upon the youth at the forward end.  Every one clung and yelled.  The car shot ahead like a bullet, and a few seconds later arrived safe and sound near the starting point.
<p>
The youth in the dainty hat had swallowed half of his cigar and was gasping for breath, while he held Tessie and the freckled boy in various positions on his lap.  Pressing him hard on the left side were the Fourth ward girl and The Sun reporter.  They disengaged themselves, and the big-eyed girl gasped:
<p>
"I'm much obliged to you, sur, fur the use av yer arm.  I'm feared I discommoded you?"
<p>
"B-by no means.  Will you take another trip?"
<p>
"Not this avenin'."
<p>
With this she tripped down the stairs and took the arm of a Bowery boy who weighed 200 pounds, and had a jaw that was well thrust forward.  His small but expressive eye was fixed aloft on The Sun reporter, who remained where he was for a reasonable time, and then came back to town on the cars.

<h4 class="title">Yesterday by the Sea<br>
Scenes and Incidents at Coney Island</h4>
... took him to one of the switchback railroads, down and up which they rattled at a pace that suggested a danger of which they seemed to take no note.
<p>These mock railroads are largely patronized, although the race is run and the five cents fare gone almost before the passengers get a second breath, and nobody seems to have any apprehension of the consequences of jumping the track while on the descent.  This confidence is possibly inspired by the fact that, as has been suggested should be done on railroads of another sort, a director is always on the train; but it is worth noting that neither the tracks nor the car wheels are examined as often as they might be.  Standing for an hour by the side of one, it was observable that it was used as often as, say, twice a minute, and each time the car was run on the descending track without the slightest examination of its condition after the journey just ended; and the thought was naturally suggested that if a wheel or axle should break in the furious descent, the car with all on it would probably be hurled through or over the surrounding fence work.  On the steam roads they test the wheels at given points but how often do they test them here?  One of the men running one of these switchback roads was asked the question, and answered indifferently that they were tested often enough, and if the road wasn't safe he wouldn't go down on it.  But if the public could be assured of this fact by witnessing frequent inspections, say of the car after a trip, there would be a more general feeling of security, and consequently more passengers every day; for it is a wild ride and highly exciting.

<h4 class="title">The Decline of the Switchback.<br>
Mournful Decadence of a Coney Island Novelty. </h4>
The charms of Coney Island seem to be fleeing one by one before the locust of the policeman and languid public patronage.  Not the least of the pleasant novelties doing the great exodus act is the switchback.  Its reign is drawing to an early close.  Coming into life but one short year ago it is departing in sections to Boston and such like provincial towns, where things get so dull in Summer that people actually patronize skating rinks during the heated term and consider it really exciting.  True, the switchbacks are not all gone, but they might as well be.  They have lost their grip on the populace and bid fair to slide wholly out of general favor as swiftly as they slid in.  When the switchback first rattled on the stage of life and Coney Island, it rolled right into business, until the rumbling of its cars vibrated the sandy shore.  It was the most picturesquely idiotic of all the picturesque idiocies with which it competed.

To the familiar recreations was added an American novelty in the shape of a roller-coaster.  The excitement of "coasting" greatly took the fancy of the portion of the British public who patronise the Palace, and although the cost of each ride was fixed at what seemed to be the somewhat prohibitive price of threepence there was an extraordinary demand for the privilege of enjoying the new sensation.  The slopes upon which the British experiments at coasting are tried are purely artificial.  They consist of a circular wooden staging erected at a considerable height from the ground.  The sledges run on rails down the steeply-inclined platform and rise halfway up the other side of the circle.  The sensation of the rapid descent is apparently highly amusing to the crowd, and for the time being this novelty seems fairly to eclipse the old-fashioned merry-go-round.

<h4 class="title">Novel Pastime At The Crystal Palace.</h4>
SIR, -- I am not an old subscriber, but much about the same, for as soon as I saw your paper I ordered a lot of back numbers.
<p>
Amusement is at present my occupation, and I was glad to notice in your last issue the paragraph as to the "Roller Coaster" at the Crystal Palace. To satisfy my curiosity I went there and very much enjoyed the going 'down and up" the inclines, and so did many others.  I, being a jolly young bachelor, took a party of young persons round at my own expense -- their parents and guardians not objecting. These excellent people had to pay the next time, and many next times after, for the young persons were clamorous in their expressions of satisfaction. 
<p>
I noticed one young lady, who I was informed takes rides several times daily and actually screams -- as it were with delight -- when going round the curve. I was only there in what may be called the young people's time, but elder folks seemed to vie with them in their appreciation. 
<p>
Thanks are due to your journal, as it has been the means of introducing many no doubt to this novel and pleasant recreation. -- Yours, 
<p>

<h4 class="title">The Patent Roller Coaster At The Crystal Palace.</h4>
As promised in our last issue we now report more fully on this interesting invention, and may say that not only has it commanded the attention of pleasure seekers, but of the scientific world, and it may be said that in every way it has most satisfactorily fulfilled the sanguine expectations of its inventors and promoters; and so to proceed. "When the north wind doth blow, and there are mountains of snow, what does the Canadian do then?" He makes himself a sort of small sledge, and starting from the top of a snow mountain is carried swiftly down one side, and then deftly round the base and up the other side to a near level of the start with pleasure to themselves and benefit to their health. 
<p>
Some intelligent American has invented a structure which gives the same exhilirating effects on the nervous system, and the same amount of healthy ozonic inspiration at all times and seasons.  It has been established in all the leading towns and cities of Western America and in many of the large cities of Eastern America. We believe Cincinnati and St. Louis rejoice "muchly" in it.
A company has patented this invention in England under the name of "Roller Coaster" -- and they have built one at the Crystal Palace, now in daily operation. It is a structure semi-elliptical, or, rather, oblong, built on supports of which the one portion is raised, so that there is a curved descent on each side. 
<p>
On these inclines railway rails are laid, and the service is b. a special patent car, as they term it -- which holds about six persons -- there is neither horse, steam, rope, or chain -- progression is made by its own momentum -- its gravity (we were going to write gravitation, but find these things are called, officially, gravity railways.) 
<p>
You take your seat on the car, and it is started very pleasantly, swiftly it proceeds -- when arriving at or about the curve the sensation is exhilirating, but peculiar.  There the car takes up the momentum which carries it up the other incline; it is estimated that just for a short distance it travels at the rate of about fifty or sixty miles an hour. 
<p>
The "Coaster" has been patronized by all classes. We think a little judicious advertising however, would bring it more before the notice of many, who frequent the Palace and only survey the grounds from the terraces. 
<p>
The structure has been reported on by an eminent engineer (Mr. Redgrave), who was professionally engaged in construction of important spans in the Health Exhibition. We found that the metals are screwed to longitudinal sleepers laid upon a floor of stout deal planks. We noticed the curves, and, although not engineers, should take it that the curves are carefully plotted, and that the gradients have been accurately laid out.
<p>
The "Coaster "was opened on the 1st June -- from that date up to 19th August it has been patronised by over 30,000 (thirty thousand) riders, From what we can gather as to the receipts this is certainly highly remunerative. We doubt if it is within our province to remark about the shares, or whether they are in the market or not -- in fact do not know.  But it may be taken generally that all companies are open to negotiations for what they operate in -- by shares, sales, royalties or what not.  On this point, however, we make no comment, nor have we sought information, but must say that there can be little doubt that after the favorable opinions expressed by the thousands who have travelled on this strange, but safe and simple "round-about," if we may be pardoned the phrase, there can be no fear as to the results which must accrue to those who were fortunate enough to be original shareholders as they will not only receive good interest, but reap a high premium should they wish to realise; moreover, in the event of any further information being required we are sure that the Secretary, at the chief office, 66, Leadenhall-street; E.C., will give every particular respecting the invention. 
<p>
Mr. McKean informs us that the company are also running a Coaster at Aston Park, Birmingham, and we can only recommend our readers to inspect and test for themselves, and we are satisfied they will find that the "Roller Coaster" will afford them all the pleasure it is claimed to give.
In conclusion some of this information was from the courteous superintendent, Mr. F. M. McKean, to whom our thanks are due, the other, in ways which are reporters' secrets. Our reporter and investigator guarantees their accuracy, and inasmuch as it has met with the complete approval of the facility, we have no hesitation in recommending our readers to follow and act on the advice given above, and when visiting the Crystal Palace take advantage of the opportunity and make an excursion on this novel American introduction.

One means of amusement in the park seems, from an aesthetic point of view, rather an abomination than otherwise.  It is called a roller coaster, makes a hideous noise, and it is a decided blot on the surrounding pretty scenery.  In justice, however, it must be admitted that this machine gave great amusement yesterday to endless crowds of people, though a sober-minded person would think there was more of terror than of fun in rushing like lightning down one incline and then up another by the momentum thus gained.

After witnessing the ascent of Mr. T.

This is a model railway on which cars are propelled down one incline, and, by the impetus thus acquired, are driven up another.  The space occupied by this railway is only the size of an ordinary garden lawn.  The outlay seemed very little, but still it was certainly the best paying show either in or outside the building.

A Collision on the Roller Coaster.--An accident occurred at the Crystal Palace on Thursday evening about six o'clock.  Two cars on the "Roller Coaster Railway" came into collision while both were running at full speed.  One of the persons employed was badly cut about the head, and a Miss Day, of Willesden-green, was so severely injured that she is not expected to recover.  Three others were cut and bruised, but not seriously.

The managers of the Roller Coaster Railway at the Crystal Palace are probably now well aware of the indiscretion of their arrangements for the diversion of holiday-makers.  It really seems as though they ought to have foreseen the possibility of such an accident as that by which on Thursday evening five persons were more or less seriously injured, one poor girl having been hurt so badly that her recovery is thought to be doubtful.  The railway consists of a single line built in a circle.  There is a high platform, from which the cars, laden with passengers, run down one incline and up another.  If the proprietors had been content to run only one carriage round this short single line, even in the event of a brake failing to act no mischief would have occurred.  The train would merely have slipped backwards, and eventually come to a standstill at the bottom.  Thursday evening, however, was a busy time at the Palace, and one car was sent down while the other was going up.  The brake of the ascending one failed to act from some cause, and the two vehicles met at the bottom with a terrible crash.

At the Crystal Palace on Thursday a serious collision occurred between two cars on the roller coaster railway, which is a simplified form of switchback, but consists of only one decline and a corresponding ascent at the top of the latter, and a number of "stops." Each car has a brake, which is dropped down to prevent the car running back down the line, which is a single one, and it would appear that either the carman forgot to use the brake or that the "stops" were defective, for a fully loaded carriage returned and met another when both were at full speed in the valley of the track.  Miss Day, of Willesden-green, was killed on the spot, one of the employes was fearfully cut about the head, and three others were cut and bruised.

<h4 class="title">Sliding Up Hill</h4>
From the Augusta (Ga.) Chronicle, June 24.<p>
A circular railway has been built at Ponce de Leon Springs.  The new railway is a wooden structure forming a circle, being 4 feet wide, 500 feet long, inside of which is laid the track for the cars, and is so graded that the cars run themselves, the highest point above the ground being 22 feet 6 inches, and the lowest point touching the ground.  Mr. Wood, at one time a poor carpenter of Toledo, Ohio, is the inventor of the circular railroad, having conceived the idea from witnessing children slide down the hills on their slide-boards, he arguing that if they could slide down hill they could slide up hill, a demonstration of which is witnessed in the circular railway.

<h4 class="title">The Circular Road In Court.<br>
The Manager Not Guilty of Violating the City Ordinances.</h4>
The circular railroad at Ponce de Leon springs has grown to be the most popular amusement for Sunday accessible to the Atlantese, and the crowds that flock thither on Sabbath afternoons are unprecedented in the annals of the place.  The police, however, were instructed to stop the operations of the erratic railway on Sundays, and made a city case against the superintendent, Mr. W. L. Peyton.  He was charged with violating section 439 of the city code, which prohibits any merchant, billiard table or ten pins alley keeper, etc., from keeping open on the Sabbath day, or trading and trafficing on that day.  Upon the hearing of the case in the recorder's court, Mr. Peyton was fined a nominal amount, and the case taken to the superior court on a writ of certiorari.  Two questions were made in the case, viz:  that the case was not within the jurisdictional limits of the city, and that, if the act done was an offense, it was an offense of which the state had jurisdiction over and above the city.  It was shown that the lines of the city were extended, by the act of February, 1877, so as to embrace Ponce de Leon springs, but the property within the limits of the extension was not made taxable and the act was only passed to give the city police powers over the territory embraced.  In the second place an offense of this nature, at the place designated, is cognizable by the state, through the regular criminal procedure, under section 4579 of the code.  Judge Hammond so held, and the circular railroad will run free of police interference in the future.

<h4 class="title">The Gravity Railway.<br>
Minneapolis Tribune.</h4>
In the winter of 1882-3, Alanson Wood, of Toledo, conceived the idea, from seeing the boys coasting on double runners, of an invention by which the same sort of sport might be indulged in summer as well as winter.  With this in mind he began the erection of the first roller coaster, a machine 400 feet in circumference (they are now 500 and 22 feet high) and 20 feet high at the highest point.  It proved more of a success than he anticipated, the speed gained by the cars on the decline carrying them up the incline, and within a short distance of the point of starting.  In July 1883, he applied for a patent, which was granted in January.  Before it was issued, J. A. Cahoon, a man of means, purchased the right, Mr. Wood reserving a royalty on rights sold.  The first three coasters were built in Toledo, then in St. Louis and all the large Southern cities.  Now they are running in nearly every city of any size in the country. The territory is sold by cities or counties and in many cases for large sums.  Cincinnati sold for $8,000 and the receipts from one coaster for the first five weeks were $8,750.  Four are being operated on Coney Island and all paying large dividends. The first roller coaster erected in this State was built by Louis A. Roth at Lake Calhoun, who purchased the right for Hennepin and Ramsey counties.  The one in the rear of the Syndicate Block was next built by the Hennepin county Gravity Railway Company and a third has just been started in St. Paul.

The sport said to be not only pleasing and exciting exercise but one that can be indulged in with perfect safety. The exercise is exhilerating and few grow weary of it.

The novel amusement structure cost $2,100 and its elevated railway, platform approaches and ticket office are generously painted in cream, red and black its spacious waiting platforms furnished with numerous sparkling red colored chairs, and the whole is lighted up with powerful electric lights of evenings.  The place was jammed on Tuesday, the opening night, notwithstanding the rain, and the crowd of riders at two trips for five cents, and curious spectators last evening required the presence of a policeman to keep order.

For several weeks a gang of men has been engaged constructing something on the corner of Cedar and Thirteenth streets that has attracted the attention of everybody who has been in that neighborhood, and caused more than ten thousand questions to be asked. The curiosity is now in full operation and proves to be a kind of self operating railway. It is about 150 feet in diameter one way, and 100 feet the other, and consists of a kind of railway track, upon which Is placed a long settee, or carriage, capable of holding twelve or fifteen people.  This carriage starts upon the elevated portion of the track and run down an incline of twenty-five or thirty feet, which gives it such an impetus that the car runs up the other side the same elevation.  It is a curiosity and naturally attracts a large crowd of people, who have an immense amount of fun and amusement riding around this oval railroad. It is called the gravity railroad and is the liveliest thing in St. Paul.  As the whole place is well lighted with electric lights, and everything about it is fresh, clean and attractive, it looks as though it would be a very popular institution.

<h4 class="title">An Unique Amusement.</h4>
St. Paul has added another popular attraction to her amusements which will unquestionably met with large public attention and approval.  We refer to the roller coaster recently erected at the corner of Thirteenth and Cedar streets, by the Ramsey County Gravity Railroad company.  On approaching the spot in the evening the attention is attracted by the brilliancy of three powerful electric lamps which shed a strong pleasant light on one of the gayest scenes imaginable.  An amphitheater of large extent, gayly painted in striking colors, the many hued dresses of feminine toilets, and the ringing hearty laugh attest joviality, good humor and furious fun.  The apparatus, a narrow track suspended in midair, which descends in curves and sharp inclines to the further side.  Two trains of two coaches each are run over the track every minute, and the momentum obtained is sufficient to carry the cars and passengers up the incline on the home stretch back to the starting point.  Such briefly are the main feature of the coaster, but in describing the ride we shall have to pause a moment to catch breath and collect our thoughts in order to do the entrancing, exhilerating sport justice.  The circle is 500 feet, the speed tremendous, just like the flight of a bird through the air, and when you reach the goal you feel that you have had a new and exciting experience in life.  The whole amusement consists in the great speed, and yet it is as safe and harmless as swinging in a crib.  It is undoubtedly a wholesome, healthy fascinating thing.  The whole establishment is conducted quietly and everything possible has been done for he comfort and pleasure of the patrons.  The best people in the city frequent the place, and we would strongly advise both ladies and gentlemen, if they wish the unique, queer sensation of flying though the air, to try the sport.  The charges are two rides, 1,000 feet for five cents.

December sports in August -- How one with a vivid imagination joined to the swaying power of a nickel can enjoy a sleigh ride under the reign of the Dog Star -- Our correspondent takes a trip upon a gravity road and moralizes upon its ups and downs as applied to life.</h4>
[Special Correspondence Daily News]<br>
Philadelphia, Pa., July 29, 1884.
<p>
A person walking along through that part of Fairmount Park skirted by the boundaries of Twenty-sixth street and Fairmount avenue will upon any clear day or evening be suddenly startled by a quick, harsh, humming noise, that begins way down in the scale, rises abruptly to a deafening height and then gradually links off into a dead silence, -- only to repeat itself the next moment in all its varying inflections.  If they will turn their eyes in a northerly direction they will see just beyond the Reading railroad tracks a peculiar cluster of frame buildings and scaffoldings surrounded by a neat picket fence and everything about dressed in a fresh, clean, cheerful and inviting coat of paint.  The entire structure has a solid, substantial, genuine appearance, and the keenest eye cannot detect a single cheap or tawdry feature to mar the stability of the curious fabric.  After the eyes have taken in a general view of the affair they will naturally halt for a few moments upon an attractive sign which tells them in three-feet letters that here one can have a
<p>
Sled Ride Down Hill<br>
Without Snow.<br>
For Five Cents.
<p>
Additional signs tell them that this is the "Wonderful Roller Coaster."  After sitting down in the shade of the park for a few minutes to meditate upon the eccentricity of an enterprise that thus forces the sports of mid-winter into the very jaws of the dog-stars, it is natural for them to want to go further and see something more of this queer affair.  We will gather up our skirts and go with them.  We pay our five cents at the ticket-office, get a little red ticket in exchange and pass through the gate and on upstairs to the starting station of the Wonderful Roller Coaster.  Upon looking around and asking a few questions we learn that some wideawake individual has here carried out a plan to entrap runaway five-cent pieces by building and conducting what is neither more nor less than a Gravity Railroad.  The road describes a somewhat irregular circle and measures five hundred feet from start to finish with, an extreme elevation of twenty-eight feet.  Three long, narrow benches with supporting backs and neatly upholstered set each upon four iron wheels, two at either end, with an automatic brake and fitted to a track about fourteen inches wide constitute the cars.  They run down and around through a sort of wooden trough about three feet wide and two and a half feet deep, and it is their journey over this gravity road which makes the humming that attracted our attention at the opening of this letter.  Sometimes when a large party collects at one time two or all three of the cars are coupled together and then the fun runs high.  Having gotten to the starting point and being provided with the necessary ticket the next best thing for us to do is to get aboard the car and take the circular trip.  When eight or ten of us have gotten seated an attendant cautions us to keep our feet upon the foot-board and to sit steady, then with the parting salute of "All Aboard," starts us slowly off.  Gradually we move to the first marked incline.  Gradually we feel the earth moving from under us, and before we know it away we go like the wind down a grade on to a short level stretch, leaving our breath and the beat of our hearts behind us.  Before we can recover the one or restore the other, we reach the second incline, and it being a sharper one than the first, we fairly shoot down it like a ball from a cannon and our faces set in a rigid stare of dread and uncertainty.  And now when we have almost lost consciousness comes the final and most terrific plunge.  We seem to actually drop down through space with the intense rapidity of the lightning's stroke and then we begin to swiftly rise and a second later are at our journey's end, having accomplished the five hundred feet in eleven seconds.  Everything is a blank during the third descent and it is not until the car is well in home that we regain our lost breath and the regular beat of our hearts.

An Accident at the Roller Coaster Rink Last Night-Six Persons Injured by the Car Leaving the Track</h4>
A somewhat peculiar but very serious accident occurred at the roller coaster rink, Eighth and Delaware sts., last night, resulting in the injury of six persons.  The coaster rink is so constructed that a car started from a certain point runs in a circle and down grade for a long distance when it strikes a rise and gradually slackens speed until it stops near the starting point.
<p>
Last night quite a crowd collected to see the sport, and Manager O. S. Mowe made a run around the track to show them that it was perfectly safe.  He noticed that the car jolted somewhat as it neared the starting point and investigated the line, but found nothing wrong.  Two successful trips were made, and when the car started on the third fully sixteen passengers were aboard.  It ran down the incline at a fearful speed, and when about sixty feet from the starting point jumped the track, crashing though the side of the rink and plunging into a pond about ten feet below.

Articles of incorporation of the Kansas City Amusement company were filed yesterday with the recorder of deeds by L. W. Towne, C. A. Brockett, J. W. Merrill, James H. Oglebay, W. C. Ebert, A. E. Hamilton, David T. Keiler, C. G. Perrin and F. M. Berkley.  The capital stock is $2,000, divided into twenty shares of $100 each.  The purpose of the organization is for purchase, sale, erection, maintenance and operation of roller coasters, roller skating, skating and bicycle rinks and public amusements in general.  The corporation is to last fifty years. The following is the present board of directors:  L. W. Towne, C. G. Perrin, C. A. Brockett, E. H. Webster and James H. Oglebay.  It is proposed by the company to refit the old roller coaster, which has been lying unused at Eighth and Delaware streets for several months past.

Supplying Kansas City's Wants<br>
Arrangements Completed and Inaugurated - Summer Opera Houses - Fair Grounds and Drives - The Natatorium - Excellent Prospect for the Future</h4>
Passing from parks, the most recent addition to the amusements is the roller coaster on Delaware st., between Eighth and Ninth, which has just been refitted and opened to the public.  The coaster is now in the most reliable hands and every precaution has been taken and every care will be exercised to guard against the possibility of accident.  In addition to the rails, a high strip has been placed along the center of the track to guide the car and assist in holding it to the track.  The coaster is now the property of the Kansas City Amusement company of which Mr. S. M. Towne is president, Mr. E. H. Webster secretary, and Mr. D. T. Keiller manager.  In addition to the coaster, the company intends putting in swings, which, together with the coaster, will be free to those paying the admission fee of five cents.  The coaster has already been running for several days, and is rapidly gaining in popular favor.  There is a peculiar fascination about the dizzy descent, the headlong plunge around the curves, and the swift ascent to the place of starting, which makes one who has taken the ride wish to repeat it.  Once or twice around, and you have forgotten your sense of danger, and give yourself up to the excitement of the dash.  It recalls the days when one delighted in a steep hill, a smooth beaten track of snow, and a break-neck "jump" which threatened annihilation every time a sled went over it.  Under the present management, the coaster promises to be a decided success.

<h4 class="title">A New Enterprise.</h4>
Geo. Burchard and Reuben Searl presented a petition to the city council last evening, to be allowed to build a roller coaster and ice cream and refreshment garden in the city park between Kentucky and Tennessee streets north of Henry street.
<p>
The roller coaster is a new thing, having only been patented last January, but has already become very popular in other places.  Three are in use in New Orleans, one in Galveston, Texas, and one is being built at Coney Island, that will cost $5,000.
<p>
They, with the city engineer looked the ground over to-day and report that it can be built without injuring the trees, and that instead of damaging the grounds they will be greatly benefited.  The track will be in the form of a circle, five hundred feet in circumference, and so constructed that the car will, under the influence of gravity alone, come around to the starting point.  Work will be commenced as soon as arrangements for the lease are completed.  It is expected it will be in running order in about two weeks.  An elegant ice cream pavilion, built in Pagoda style, will be erected in the center.  The intention is to make it, what Lawrence at present is without, a pleasant resort during warm weather.--Herald.

<h4 class="title">Coasting in the Summer.</h4>
The "roller coaster" that has been under construction by Messrs. Burchard and Searle for several weeks, was completed yesterday so as to permit a trial.  The first car was run at 9:30 a. m.  In the afternoon a Journal reporter visited the park and took a "slide."
<p>
The construction of the coaster is as follows:  Near the Henry street entrance to the park is a trestle work nine feet from the ground.  This runs toward the east, then crosses to the North and runs along through the trees for about 200 feet; then curving to the west it crosses an elevation of ground and begins the steep descent among the trees again, curving to the south and thence shooting up grade to the starting point.  The length of this trestle is about 540 feet.  In the first fifty-seven feet there is a fall of six feet; in the next 177 feet, two feet fall; in next sixty-eight feet, eight feet fall; in next fifty-six feet, two feet fall; then comes a rise of nine feet in seventy-eight feet, to the landing place where the car stops to empty its load and from which the car is pushed up an incline to the platform which is made the starting point.
<p>
On the trestle is laid a tight board floor on which is built a track for the cars to run.  The track is so constructed as to prevent the car from running off and a stout railing three feet high is built on each side of the track.  There is no possibility of accident unless something breaks, which is quite unlikely, as everything is constructed with a view to great strength.  There will be four cars and these make the trip around the 530 feet in about twenty seconds.  
<p>
An elegant pavilion has been built, in which there will be seats and tables for refreshments.  A band stand has been erected for the musicians, hammocks and swings will be put about the park, walks and seats have been built under the trees and the entire park has been handsomely fixed up.   It will be a delightful resort.  The public opening will be next Tuesday.

<h4 class="title">No Need for Alarm.</h4>
In justice to Messrs. Searl &amp; Burchard we desire to say that the accident at the roller coaster in Kansas City a day or two since, need cause no alarms as to the safety of the one in this city.  The Kansas City coaster had been moved from one place to another at least four times.  It was old and badly worn and not properly constructed in the first place.  There is scarcely a possibility of an accident taking place at the coaster of Messrs. Searl &amp; Burchard.  It is entirely different in its construction to the one in Kansas City.  It is new, and so arranged that a car could no possibly break through.  A gentleman from this city was present at the time of the accident in Kansas City.  He had taken a ride a short time before, and perceived at once that the track was improperly built and an accident liable to occur at any minute.  He immediately went to the proprietor and implored him to stop running the cars, telling him that he would certainly kill some one.  The proprietor paid no attention to his warning, and the gentleman then threatened to call the chief of police and force him to stop the coaster, so positive was he that an accident would occur.  A very few minutes after a car full of people was hurled from the track to the ground below and a number of persons injured. The proprietors of the roller-coaster here deserve much credit for providing our citizens with so attractive a pleasure resort, and it is to be hoped they will receive a liberal support.  It is a vast improvement on the smoky billiard hall and noisy saloon, where ladies are not permitted and the language not always the most elegant.  Out roller coaster as now conducted should be encouraged.

About one hundred feet of the roller-coaster track was moved from its foundation, but it is so firmly joined together that the framework did not break.

Aston Lower Grounds.--Within the last fortnight another novelty has been added to the attractions at the Aston Lower Grounds in the form of a construction known as "The American Roller Coaster."  It consists of a miniature elevated railroad, erected on substantial supports, having its gradients so arranged that the cars placed on the rails run once round without any extraneous help.  The thing is a decided novelty in the Midlands.  The speculation is in the hands of the Roller Coaster Company (Limited), London, who have similar "coasters" at work at the Crystal Palace, and are erecting others in different parts of the country.

<h4 class="title">ROLLER COASTING.</h4>
Indianapolis has a new sporting craze to open ay 5 p. m. today, at 475 East Washington street, and promises to supersede any and all sports yet offered to the public.  Curiosity has for some time been on tiptoe by reason of the great show of circular building, bridging and platform construction in progress as the above named locality, and much questioning is now answered that it is the famous Òroller coastingÓ which is so popular at Philadelphia and at Brighton Beach and Coney Island, but which Indianapolis now has built on a larger scale and more prefect construction than has before been attempted.  It consists of an elevated track, constructed on such a series of inclines as to precipitate the cars from the high starting point of beginning over an eight of a mile circuit.  A wonderful rate of speed is attained and the sensation experienced is said to be indescribable.  Of course the machine is so constructed as to preclude the possibility of accident. <p>
Trial trips were made this morning preparatory to the opening this 5 p. m. with great satisfaction to D. C. Mitchell, the architect, and the gentlemanly management.  Large crowds are gathered to witness the finishing touches and anxious to take the first ride.

The roller coasting sport was Inaugurated last evening at the grounds, 475 East Washington street, and proved beyond expectations of the management. <p>
The track is well constructed and the arrangements for handling the people are very complete.

<h4 class="title">Painted Red.</h4>
The town on East Washington street has been "painted red," as the phrase goes.  At least that part covered by the roller coasting tracks.  The scene last night is described as something very animated and the crowd a much delighted throng.  The velocity of the cars in making the circuit is almost past computation, the undulation of the tracks over the inclines, strongly suggesting the soaring of the eagle.  Certain it is, that the sport is taking strong hold upon the public.  The management are much praised on every hand for their painstaking care to please the people and the provisions adapted against every form of accident.  The street car company are arranging to extend their switches to render better accommodations to travel.  The coaster is situated about thee blocks east of the railroad crossing on Washington street.

At Crystal Palace, in England, one of the principal attractions is a roller coaster and thousands of visitors patronize it daily.  Indianapolis, it seems, is not to be outdone in such enterprises, and has just established a roller coaster at 475 East Washington street.  This place of amusement is now attracting hundreds of our best citizens--men, women and children.  A Times man took a ride yesterday and sped along better than a mile a minute on a lightning express.  There is not the least danger, as it is impossible for an accident to occur.

A new sporting craze which has been afflicting the east for some time is called roller coasting.  As it has been introduced at Indianapolis, there will naturally be some interest to ascertain what it is.  It consists of an elevated track, constructed on such a series of inclines as to precipitate the cars from a high starting point around the circular track to the place of beginning, over an eighth of a mile circuit.  A wonderful rate of speed is attained and the sensation experienced is said to be indescribable.  Of course the machine is so constructed as to preclude the possibility of accident.  Bob Smith, of this city, will shortly go to Indianapolis to examine the new scheme and may arrange a coasting house here.

<h4 class="title">Society</h4>
Indianapolis society is very dull at present, and the elite of that city are amusing themselves at the "roller coaster."  This "roller coaster" is probably new to Fort Wayne people, as it has been built only in Kansas City, New Orleans, and Indianapolis.  It is built after the manner of the elevated railroad, but in a circle.  The cars are no more or less than a common church bench on wheels.  The car is started from the station about sixty feet higher than the earth, and goes down the track with such force that it is carried clear around, in less time than it takes to tell it.  The sensation after riding one of these "flying cars" is such as to cause the occupants to become convulsed with laughter.  To get a good idea of what the "roller coaster" is, one should ride in it, and he will immediately become fascinated, and like everyone else who has ridden, will cry for more.  When the "roller coaster" becomes more generally known Fort Wayne may be lucky enough to have one.

Briefly described, It is a sort of an open carriage with the wheels running on a track in which there are frequent and steep declivities, which has a tendency to accelerate the speed to an alarming degree.  It is great fun, however, and after the first nervousness has worn away, there is no especial reason to fear an accident.  The place was crowded--men, women and children pushed and pulled in their efforts to get up the steps to the carriages, while two or three attaches vainly tried to keep them in line and order.  From a grove just back of the coaster came the strains of music and a big tent and numerous small ones were visible.  ...

It is 500 feet in circumference, and in its circuit it has three elevations, the higher one being twenty- four feet above the ground, and the lowest point of the track being about one foot above the ground.  Upon the small iron track, which is on the circuit, are two cars capable of holding fifteen persons each.  When started from the highest point of the track, a car makes the complete circuit in seventeen seconds.  It was largely patronized on Saturday afternoon and is destined to become a popular attraction.  It was built by Miller &amp; Co., and since has been purchased by C. H. Covell &amp; Co.

The skating rink is about closing, and the "roller coasters" will naturally follow suit.  The success of the latter, which was erected late in the season, has been remarkable.  It is said that $3000 was paid for the right to use the land adjoining the Nantasket House for this purpose, and the cost of the structure was about half this sum; yet the receipts have been as high as $300 in a single evening.  The "roller coaster" is a curious contrivance, the inclines and rises on the course being so arranged that the sled gets sufficient impetus on the down grades to force it up the ascents, so that the ordinary trouble of pulling a "runner" up-hill is almost entirely obviated.

Inauguration of the New Amusement.</h4>
The roller coaster is the newest device to amuse the people and as in all other progressive matters, Winona loses no time in securing one and erecting it in the best style possible.  It is located on the street car line on West Fifth street, opposite the old Huff House gardens, and occupies a plat of ground 160 by 160 feet square, whereon is erected a circular gravity railway, its highest elevation being twenty-four feet and eight inches, and its lowest elevation is two feet above the ground.  The grounds are enclosed by a substantial fence ten feet high with a pavillion inside provided with comfortable seats for visitors.  The cars arrived on Thursday and there was a large number of people at the roller coaster last evening to witness the novelty.  Two rides for five cents is the price charged and it is hilarious sport for old or young and destined to become a popular resort.  Mr. George B. Russell, an old time compositor in The Republican office has the management of the roller coaster and his large experience in the amusement line is a guaranty that it will be conducted in a manner to meet the approval of the citizens of Winona.

An Enthusiastic Crowd on the Roller Coaster.</h4>
After being baffled by the unseasonable chill of last week the crowd bent on enjoying the fun on the roller coaster gathered in force on Wednesday, lured by the delightful Spring night, the music of the band and the exhilarating sport of the novel invention which has caught the public like a whirlwind.  The street cars going up to the west end carried many people to the coaster, while many went on foot and in carriages.  The grounds were brilliant with many lights, while the Gate City band in full force discoursed some fine music.  People poured through the entrance to the grounds in a living stream, taxing the good-natured ticket seller to meet the demand.  Upwards of a thousand tickets had been sold up to nine o'clock.  Ascending the stairway the visitor found himself in the midst of a lively throng of men, women and children, young and old, laughing and chatting, strolling about on the large elevated platform, listening to the music, watching the roller coasters as they whizzed around the track, following each other every minute.  The Republican representative was advised that he had no time to loose so he "caught on" to the first car that appeared.  Along side were a couple of business men bound on a little sport though both were dreadfully anxious lest in the dizzy whirl they should lose their packages of breakfast beefsteak.  The car started down the grade at a lively rate, the velocity increasing with each second.  There are two or three places where the grade is very steep and the sensation as the car drops down the decline fairly takes one's breath.  The girls scream, the boys shout and in the next second the car is mounting the home stretch, completing the round in thirteen seconds.  The sport is great and is catching everybody.  The Roller Coaster is bound to be a very popular Summer resort.

A petition was received from Jesse A. Melcher, the School Director, asking for a franchise for five years, permitting O. S. Mame of Kansas City, Mo., and H. H. Reynolds, to operate the roller-coaster and circular gravity railway upon such premises as they may buy, lease or control.  The petition stated that the coaster is a means of popular amusement quite common in Eastern cities.  It is not propelled by steam, but by force of gravity, upon the principle of the inclined plane.  There is no danger of collision, as but one car at a time is allowed to run, and the second is not started until the first has reached its destination.  It is patronized by adults as well as children, affording healthy exercise.  The petition was referred to the Street Committee.

<h4 class="title">A Circular Railway</h4>
At the corner of Eighth and Mission streets is to be seen in operation something decidedly new for San Francisco.  It is called the circular gravity railway.  It is a rather complicated machine, being circular in shape and about 200 feet in diameter, elevated at one end to about twenty-five feet, and descending to the ground on the opposite side, when it begins to ascend.  Upon this is placed a car or settee, capable of seating ten or twelve persons, which, when a fare of five cents is collected from each person wishing to ride, is pushed off down the incline at an alarming rate of speed.  The momentum is so great, and the track is so arranged that the car ascends again on the other side till it reaches the starting point, where the passengers are discharged to make way for others.

The circular gravity railroad machine is now being operated as an experiment at the corner of Eighth and Mission streets.  The principle is that of the pendulum.  When the passengers are seated the car is pushed down a steep grade, upon a track, and the momentum carries it up a height on the other side.

<h4 class="title">The Roller Coaster
Coasting.<br>
The New Amusement Fairly Inaugurated in This City--Scenes and Incidents at the Track. </h4>
The first car of the roller coaster was started around the circle at Fifteenth street and Broadway, freighted with Mr. Sherline, the Superintendent, and a courageous Tribune reporter.  The latter has faced death in many forms (at the Morgue), and he was not afraid.  He sat down in the car with a firm determination that come what might he would not flinch, that if the car jumped the track he would abide the consequences, whatever they might be--whether the Coroner or Woolsey's Hospital.  Riding on a coaster is a queer sensation, combining as it does a vague sense of danger where none exists, and the exhilaration of flying around a circle with the speed of the wind.  The first descent is gradual, rolling the car out on to a level about thirty feet long, after which another descent is made, down which the car speeds with the velocity of a thunderbolt, and swift enough to take the breath from a cigar store Indian.  This descent gives the car sufficient momentum to send it to the upper landing, where the passengers alight and walk seventeen feet to the point of beginning.  The track is in excellent condition, and four cars or settees are provided for the patrons of the coaster.  These settees are simply a long seat, comfortably upholstered, running on four small iron wheels, resembling a sofa, or "the soft seats at Schellhaas'," more than anything else, so that a passenger who rides on one involuntarily imagines that he is swinging round the circle on a bed lounge.  To highten the effect one of the settees is painted red, this one appears to be the favorite with the public.  The settees arrived yesterday afternoon at half-past five o'clock, and last evening an immense throng assembled at the track, where the cars ran crowded until a late hour.  A band of music discoursed some fine music and two electric lights illumined the animated scene.  The small boy was very numerous and his shrill yells as the car rushed down the track could be heard five blocks.  Ladies were at first somewhat timid about making the trip, but finally this was overcome, and many cars swung round loaded exclusively with women and girls, whose merry laughter rang out on the night air like the chiming of distant bells, and all that sort of thing.  One old gentleman who has not coasted for thirty-seven years chartered a car for half a dollar, and made the circuit alone, lying full length on his stomach, as he did when a boy coasting down his native hills of New England.  He said he felt ten years younger after the experience, and he would have repeated the trip in the same way if the waiting crowd had not been so impatient.  One young lady after alighting from the settee, remarked that she felt as if she had been waltzing with a turbine wheel.  A scientific gentleman paralyzed the crowd by saying that he felt like a rotatintimonicon.  But everybody who rides, rides again, and the enterprise promises to be very successful.

The Exposition Booming in a Way Never Seen before in Its History</h4>
Mr. W. D. Owens, of St. Louis, will exhibit a roller coaster, which is an apparatus whereby one can slide down hill on a sled without snow.  It works on the same principle as roller skating, and is a very popular amusement in some of the eastern cities.  It will occupy a space 125 feet in diameter.

Darby, of Indianapolis, has secured sufficient space for the erection of a circular gravity railway.  This is like the roller coasting that has become so popular in the large cities.  The track is built in a series of circular inclines, so that the car runs with great velocity back to its original starting point.

A Roller Coaster in the Garden City.<br>
Five Hundred Feet in Twelve Seconds--The New and Latest Amusement.</h4>
The peculiar looking structure in the vacant lot on Santa Clara street between Sixth and Seventh, which has attracted so much attention, is completed and commenced business at 2 o'clock this afternoon.  It is a centrifugal railway five-hundred feet in circumference, built of Oregon pine in a most substantial manner, and it is known as a roller coaster.  It is designed exclusively for healthful pleasure.  A car starts from the highest point, about 30 feet above the ground and runs around the circuit, touching a point near the ground and rising again to within a few feet of the starting point.  In a word it is coasting without ice, and the sensation is said to be particularly delightful.  It is the latest craze in the way of popular amusement, and Coasters may be found in all of the principal Easter and European cities.  The car contains nine persons, and is is [sic] so constructed that it is impossible for it to jump the track.  it makes the circuit in twelve seconds.  The Coasters are patronized by all classes of people, the majority of the patrons being adults.  The exercise is invigorating, causes the blood to circulate lively and is recommended by physicians.  Three electric lights have been placed on the grounds.  A single ride will cost 5 cents and ten tickets will be sold for 25 cents.  It is certainly a novel idea, and it is a wonder that nobody ever thought of it before.  It is supposed that a crowd will be in attendance this evening watching the cars spinning around in the glare of the electric lights.

<h4 class="title">Cheap Excitement.</h4>
The very latest novelty from America, in the form of an aerial railroad, is now in full swing at the junction of Nicholson and Gertrude-streets. We have personally experienced the peculiar sensation of riding on the cars, and can confidently recommend the pastime to any of our readers who find the mild form of insanity displayed by the Army insufficient for their daily wants. Most of our readers are no doubt aware of the system on which the cars work,--i. e. gravity,--but to thoroughly understand the principle of Newton's discovery a ride on the American Gravity Railroad Company's cars is a necessity. The distance travelled is considerable, the speed tremendous, and the excitement intense. The proprietors, Messrs Kilbourn and Ciphers inform us that there are eight similar establishments in New York city, and the business done is immense. The price of admission is 3d including a ride on the cars, and considering all things, we cannot help thinking that it is decidedly the cheapest form of excitement hitherto introduced.

A popular place of recreation now is the enclosure of the American Gravity Railroad Company, in which any person desirous of obtaining a startling sensation can go through all the concentrated terror of a Cootamundra accident for the small charge of three pence, and at the sacrifice of none of his corporal members. The experience of being shot down an inclined plains with terrible velocity, for the simple purpose of mounting a similar gradient by means of the impetus originally secured, affords satisfaction to thousands of our citizens, and the result is that the roar of the well patronised tram cars is incessant, and must make it very lively for those methodical people in the neighborhood who retire to rest at an early hour; and from this example of Yankee ingenuity it is easy to step over to the exhibition aquarium ...

<h4 class = "title">The Drama in Australia</h4>
Notes by Scalfax<br>
Melbourne, March 17<br>
... <br>
The Gravity Railway has not killed anyone yet, and the owners are making money fast.  The charge is threepence, the cars hold about eight persons, and the journey is made in fourteen seconds.  I have watched the proceedings for twenty minutes at a time, and there was generally a car load on the way.  Which proves that you do not want a University education to become abominably wealthy.<br>
... <br>
Did you ever see a gravity railroad?  We have got one now, and most of us spend our time inviting our worst enemies to ride upon it.  Imagine a circular railway three hundred yards round, with some very awkward inclines, one of more than 45 deg., and you have the track, which, at the starting and finishing point, is thirty feet from the ground.  On this runs an open carriage, holding a dozen people.  When the carriage is let go it spins down the inclines with a terrific force, and its momentum is sufficient to carry it right up an incline to the starting point.  I took the time of ten trips, and the average was fourteen seconds; pretty good running for three hundred yards.  I have not been on it yet; I want to live a few years more, but the sensation must be the reverse of pleasant.  The passengers generally get on full of smiles and fun, but they come off without a word.  One of the inclines is most terribly steep, and the sensation, going down at such a speed, must be sickening.  If you have been on a pitching ship, or on an ordinary railway when descending an incline, you will understand what it is like, only you must magnify that sensation say a thousand fold.  If any accident should happen to a car while at full speed the consequences might be disastrous, for parts of the railway are high above the ground.  There would be some new kinds of comets round there.  I remember a similar railway in Birmingham, on which a wheel came off, and the passengers were all seriously injured.  In London we had some time ago a centrifugal railway, on which the people actually turned heels over head without noticing it, the speed was so great.

It is an inclosed track running in a circular form and standing at an angle of about 45 degrees.  The distance around will be several hundred feet, and will be travelled over at the rate of about 150 miles per hour.  On the floor below this track and within the circle will be a large skating ring.  The machinery has come by the Mariposa.  It will be on Beretania street and be ready in about three weeks.

<h4 class="title">The "Roller Coaster."</h4>
The roller coaster was patented in Philadelphia, January, 1884.  Since then fully a dozen have been put up in the United States, including one near Golden Gate Park, San Francisco.
<p>
One has just been put up in this city and is already fixed in popular favor.
Mr. D. B. Smith, a new comer, has leased from Roadmaster Hart the lot on the south east corner of Punchbowl and Beretania streets; the lease being for five years.  The lot is irregular in shape, about 200 by 300 feet in size.
The coaster has been erected in this lot by Mr. Smith who is sole proprietor.  It is a circular railway track elevated so as to form a descending and an ascending incline plane.
<p>
The track platform is about 900 feet long and five feet wide; the track, of steel rails, 3 1/4 inches by 1 1/4 inches, is 14-inch gauge.  The trackway is supported by 4 by 6 uprights, braced by 2 by 4 inch scantlings.  It is further braced by northwest planking--not for necessary solidity, but to prevent jarring.
<p>
Inside the circle a flight of steps, some 20 feet wide, with two landings leads to the summit of the track.  Seats are provided on the landings.  The cars, three in number, are 11 feet long, each will hold 8 or 9 persons--according to size of passengers.  No cars will be in motion at once.  Mr. Smith says that the structure is as stable as any he has seen in the United States.  He intends to put up a large skating rink inside the area of the coaster.  It will be 75 x 150 feet in surface, will be roofed and have latticed sides to insure ventilation.

The Roller Coaster is now in operating nearly every evening and the skating rink probably, will be completed next week, and the grounds enclosed and handsomely laid out in walks, flower beds, etc., so arranged as to make it, at all times, a pleasant place of resort.

<h4 class="title">The Deadly Roller Coaster.<br>
The Fall of a Platform Precipitates a Crowd of Children to the Ground and Injures Several.</h4>
Persons who have often passed along Superior or Huron street while the new roller coaster has been in course of construction, opposite the Gendron Iron Wheel factory, and have seen the crowds of school children who raced and ran and played over the elevated railway, have expected daily to hear of an accident happening in that vicinity.  To-day at noon the expectations were fulfilled, and the papers must record a disaster that is even greater than was expected.  To-day the cars on the coaster were first started, and after the morning session of school, a large crowd of pupils from the Erie street building congregated to see the wonderful thing work.  The children were given free rides around the elevated circle, and child-like, enjoyed it as great sport.  A large number, said to be all the way from 25 to 50, of the youngsters collected on the elevated platform, about sixteen feet from the ground, from which the cars start on their rapid run around the circle.  The operator of the coaster says he warned the children that their combined weight was too great for the light platform to withstand, but, like children, they took no heed, and did not understand the danger until the central portion of the platform floor gave way and precipitated them all to the ground below, the timbers and the frame ticket house falling upon them.  The children fell in a mass upon the ground, and were piled a yard deep, a screaming, crying mass of youthful humanity.  It is said that the youngsters at first were left to disentangle themselves as best they might, but the under ones were found bruised, crushed and immobile.
<p>
The patrol wagon was sent for, and it, with the assistance of people called to the place, carried the wounded boys to their houses.  It is a difficult matter to learn who was seriously injured, and what the extent of their injuries were, but as far as can be ascertained the following were quite seriously hurt, the injuries ranging from mashed faces to broken backs:  George Waldvogel, Ed. Cockrill, Samuel Jordan, James Wallack, Rob Albrecht and a boy named Cotter who is said to be fatally hurt.  Many others were bruised and sprained.
<p>
The proprietor of the roller coaster, Alanson Wood, states to a Blade reporter that he was testing his machinery to see how much gas was consumed by the engine he uses to carry the cars over the top of the track to give them another start, and he says the children came into the grounds without his consent.  They crowded upon the platform notwithstanding his warning, and the weight was too much for the frame work, which being made with a view of its portability, is very light.  The cause of the accident, he says, was the slipping of a clevis in one of the central uprights, and this created a panic, which was followed by the fall of the floor.  Another man, who was an eye-witness, alleges that no precautions whatever were taken to keep the children away, and that Mr. Woods was more anxious regarding the damage to his machinery than he was of the welfare of the children.  There are so many contradictory reports it is difficult to get at the bottom facts.  This is known, however, a very serious accident occurred, several children were badly, if not fatally, hurt and probably crippled for life.  It is hoped that their condition is not as bad as at first reported, and that extra precautions will be taken to prevent a recurrence of the catastrophe.
<p>
The patrol wagon took two of the wounded boys to their homes, Sam Jordan, hurt internally, to No. 60 John street, and Henry Butz, with face cut and bruised, to his home on Oak, near Water.

<h4 class="title">Roller Coaster Accident.<br>
Three Boys Badly Injured by the Breaking Down of a Platform.</h4>
A roller coaster, which had just been completed at the corner of Superior and Oak streets by Mr. Alanson Wood, was being tested, about 11:30 this morning, when a number of children, who had just been dismissed from the Andrews and Catholic schools, went running up the incline to the platform upon which the ticket office stood, for the purpose of watching the working of the engine.  This platform was held in place by adjustable supports, known as telescope posts, which can be raised or lowered at will, and were supposed to be perfectly safe.  After about twenty children had crowded upon the platform, the sliding posts suddenly gave way, and they were precipitated suddenly a distance of twenty feet to the ground.  A portion of the heavy platform, about 4 by 10 feet in dimension, fell upon them, but the ticket office fortunately toppled over on one side.
<p>
For a few moments there was the most intense excitement, and the proprietor and his assistants were paralyzed with horror, for they feared that a number of the children must be killed.  The section of the platform was quickly lifted off by some of the bystanders, and it was found that nearly all of the victims had escaped with slight bruises, although all of them were beside themselves with fright.  The patrol wagon came in response to a summons, and conveyed two of the injured ones to their homes, while others were assisted home by their friends.
<p>
Mr. Wood states that the coaster was not yet ready for business, and he had done his utmost to keep the children off from the track and platform.  One or two ran up, and the rest followed like a flock of sheep.  He was greatly agitated on account of the accident, and said that before he opened the gates to the public he intended to have every support tested and strengthened so as to make an accident of this kind impossible.  The boys who were present corroborated his statement that he tried to keep them away.  Two little girls were among those who fell, but they were uninjured.
<p>
[...]
<p>
... Considering the distance of the fall, the condition of the ground and the large number who fell, it is certainly a wonder that so few were badly hurt.  It seems miraculous that many were not killed outright.

Toledo, April 15.<p>
While a party of school children were gathered to-day upon the platform of a new roller coaster, the cars of which were being tried for the first time, the floor gave away precipitating the entire party about 25 in number to the ground, a distance of 20 feet, a portion of the structure falling on them.  Three boys were seriously injured, one it is feared fatally, and eight more or less hurt.

As hoped yesterday the roller coaster accident did not prove to be as disastrous as first reported.  The boy Cottrell, attended by Dr. Pooley, was only slightly hurt, and is all right now; Eddie Waldvogel, with a cut eye, is reported safe by Dr. Bodman; young Sam Jordan, was the worst hurt of any, and Dr. Bigelow says that as he has not heard from his patient he is probably all right.

<h4 class="title">The Roller Coaster</h4>
This novelty in amusement has been constructed on Fort street, near Vancouver, and will be opened on Monday evening at 6:30.  The pastime is a comparatively new invention, not yet twelve months in use, but has jumped at once into popularity from the exciting and exhilirating nature of the sport.  The large cities in the east have them, and even Honolulu boasts a gravity railroad.  The railway is constructed in a series of dips, starting from the station at top abruptly, and gaining such momentum that when at bottom the little open car fairly whirls through the air and climbs the grade to the top again easily.  The sensation is pleasant and about as agreeable as a toboggan slide, with this in its favor, that there is no reclimbing the hill to take a second ride.  It will, no doubt, prove a great attraction for every one from its novelty.  
<p>
The grounds are situated on Fort and View streets, near Vancouver, and will hereafter be called "Central Park," as it is the intention of the proprietor, Mr. J. Warfel, to beautify the grounds by planting trees and flowers and building walks and fountains, making it a pleasant place generally to spend an afternoon.  At the opening to-morrow evening a band will be in attendance, and refreshments served from a booth on the grounds.
<p>
Messrs. Sherline &amp; Mayder, the builders, have constructed about twenty of these gravity railroads in different parts of the east and south.  Mr. J. Johnston is manager.  The price per ride has been fixed at five cents.

<h4 class="title">Novel Sport on the South Side.<br>
A "Roller Slide" to Be Built in National Park</h4>
A company is being formed to establish a novel sport on the South side.  Parties have made an arrangement with the manager of the National park for space to erect what is termed a "roller slide," and work on the structure will be commenced in a short time.  It is proposed to build a platform on an incline, a long slope to extend from the point of starting, around in a circle and back up to the point of starting, of strong trestle-work covered with heavy planking, the whole to be in the form of a double hill, extending from a given point in a circle back to the highest point.  On this will be built a double iron track.  A contrivance similar to a sled, provided with iron rollers, is run on this.
<p>
The sled or boat is mounted by the coaster, and being given a start at the top, shoots down the incline on its rollers and the iron track like an ordinary sled on an icy hill.  The start given the concern, together with the momentum gathered in the descent of the first inline, carries it up the opposite ascent and back to the place of starting.  By giving the contrivance another gentle push, the trip may be repeated.  The "roller slide" is a favorite sporting appliance in Europe, but is little known in the United States, the one to be erected at National park being the first of the kind to be built in the west.

The sensation produced by the first ride is that of a "goneness," and when the car reaches the last dip in the track it attains a fearful velocity which sends it to the starting-point again, making the distance in thirteen seconds.  When necessary four cars a minute are run, the receipts of each car are 20 cents and the total receipts yesterday afternoon and evening were over $200.  The company have the rights for the state of Wisconsin and are putting in roller-coasters in the large interior towns.

<p>
The scheme of the Roller Coaster, I mentioned in my last letter.  I have examined the construction, and find that it consists of a circular track on trestle work.  The cars start from a platform, down an enclosed inclined plane and run on a narrow track with two roads.  The momentum carries the cars back to the place of starting.  The track is 1/8 of a mile, and the circuit is made in 15 seconds, or at the rate of a mile a minute.  Six persons can ride on a car, and from 8 in the morning, until 9 at night, it appears to be well patronized.  Of course it costs quite a sum of money to construct the track but as a permanent institution, as it is here, all the season it is a money making one, as almost every person desired to try a ride and are so well satisfied they venture the second or third time.

Walter H. Smith has introduced a novelty at Savin Rock this season. It is what is termed a "California Coaster." A circular railway is built at a considerable elevation, and so constructed as to cause a car to run with celerity the round of the track from the momentum which it gets from the down grade of a part of the track. In California where the idea originated the boys there make "Coasters" consisting of large sleds run by wheels.  The undulating condition of the roads makes it easy for them to enjoy the sport, as they can go a great distance.  In Coney Island and numerous other pleasure resorts, the "coaster" is an attractive feature, and the one here will doubtless prove a success.  Mr. Smith will also have a tricycle rink.  Refreshments of all kinds will be kept at the establishment. Chas. L. Card will act as manager.  The opening occurs June 23d.

Mr. Enos Foot and Charles L. Card, the Fancy Skater, in Court.</h4>
Judge Studley heard from Lawyer Bennett an argument in favor of dissolving the injunction restraining Foot and Card from operating the "coaster" in West Haven. A long statement was made of the business complications between the parties interested.  Card had advanced $300 to complete the "coaster" belonging to Walter H. Smith. He was to have all the receipts till paid besides $15 a week.  After being paid Smith was to have all receipts. The "coaster" needing some further appurtenances Card borrowed $200 of Enos Foot, assigning his personal interest to Foot. Card and Foot have been in possession, and Mr. Ackrill has been operating the "coaster" for them. Thursday Judge Pickett granted an injunction restraining Foot and Card from interfering with Smith in running the "coaster."  This does not prevent Card from receiving any money earned by the "coaster," but enables Smith to stay on the premises and watch things.<p>
Lawyer Bennett asked that this injunction might be modified so as not to interfere with the agreements between the parties and so that the coaster would be run as usual. Lawyers John C. Gallagher and Harry W. Asher, who appeared for Smith, responded that all their client wanted was to be allowed to carry out the terms of his agreement without molestation from Foot. The judge said that should the business proceed as usual and Manager Ackrill is to go on with the business, Smith may help ran the coaster if he so desires.  Next Tuesday a hearing will be held in the Common Pleas court to try and put the injunction aside altogether.

<h4 class="title">Brighton Beach Hotel.<br>
A New Summer Resort to Be Opened Below Sandwich.</h4>
About 20 invited guests boarded the steamer Excelsior at Miller's wharf, near the foot of Woodward avenue, yesterday afternoon and went down the river to test the hospitality of George Buchanan, proprietor of Brighton Beach, the new summer resort below Sandwich.  The place is yet unfinished, but enough can be seen to give an idea of what it will be when the plans are carried out.  The hotel fronts the river.  For the convenience of vehicles a driveway has been graded from a point below the sulphur springs across the fields, lessening the distance from the springs over a quarter of a mile.  Seats are scattered under the trees, and graveled walks abound.  Behind the hotel a roller coaster 450 feet around, built on the plan of the coaster at Coney Island, is in course of erection, and Mr. Buchanan talks of grading a plot where base ball, lacrosse and other games can be played.

"I learned on the outside that [D. K.] Mason is now in the employ of George Buchanan.  The latter, in addition to his summer hotel near Windsor, which, by the way, is fitted up handsomely, by a shrewd business deal secured a patent or something of the kind on a roller coaster.  This promises to yield him a fortune.  Buchanan employed Mason to dispose of the territorial rights.  Mason is making a good living out of it, but I hardly think there are 'millions in it' for him."

Looking up the law on the subject he found it would cost him $25 per month to take out a license.  He applied to the city for one, but the Mayor refused him, alleging that the ordinance failed to provide for such a license as he wanted.  The police have also threatened to interfere with his business if he started.  Wood claims that his invention comes under the head of amusements and yesterday filed a bill in the Circuit Court to compel the Mayor to issue him a license.  He also asks for an injunction to restrain the police from interfering with in in any manner.  Judge Tuley will hear the motion for injunction this morning, at which time Wood is to serve notice on the city officials.

Denver People Invited to Indulge in a New Amusement This Evening in the Shape of a Roller Coaster.</h4>
A new amusement of roller coasting will be introduced to Denver people for the first time this evening.  The amusement is said to resemble in some ways toboganning, and to be equally fascinating without the danger.  In another respect the sport is much superior to all ordinary coasting as the sled does not have to be dragged up hill, neither do people have to walk up hill once for every time they go down but can ride both ways.  Roller coasting is now a very successful and popular amusement in San Francisco, Stockton and San Jose, Cala., also at Coney Island, New York, Philadelphia, Indianapolis, St. Paul, Minneapolis, Boston, and other points East.  The coaster is perfectly safe, the construction being especially strong.  The track will be illuminated by electric lights and the fare will be only 5 cents.  The coaster is owned exclusively by Denver men, and all who want to enjoy the novelty of sliding down hill in summer would do well to patronize the enterprise.  The coaster will start on its journeys this evening at 7 o'clock, and will be run every evening till 10 o'clock except Sunday evening, and from 2 to 6 o'clock every Saturday afternoon.
<p>
All the respectable people of Denver are invited to attend on this and succeeding evenings and enjoy the new sport.  The coaster is located at Twenty-third and Welton streets.  Courteous treatment extended to all visitors and patrons.

The "coaster" runs down an inclined plane erected for the purpose at Twenty-third and Welton streets, and the new sport is very interesting and inspiring.  Street cars on the Welton street, Twenty-third street, and other lines are now labeled "to the roller coaster."<p>
Children are especially delighted with the new sport, and the managers assure the public that the coaster is perfectly safe and that the sport exceeds anything in the line of flying horses whirligigs or other contrivances, and is fully equal to tobbagganning, the great Canadian sport, while it has the advantage over all ordinary coasting that it can be enjoyed in warm weather without overcoats or mufflers.  Rides are only 5 cents.<p>
The coaster was in full running order last evening.  There was a vast crowd of spectators and a still larger crowd to enjoy the sport. Arrangements have been made for a grand roller coaster matinee for ladies and children this afternoon.

This has been done in Chicago with success.  Whether the same could be done in Denver or not is not so certain, but it is quite evident that the attempt will be made.

Glenwood Park, including its buildings, has been leased to Messrs. L. W. Cass & Co., who will soon open the hall again as a thoroughly equipped, metropolitan skating rink, with many special attractions and manage it as a pleasure resort for old any young, excluding absolutely every objectionable feature.  They will in a few weeks erect a fine roller coaster in the park similar to those at Coney Island, New York, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, St. Paul, Kansas City, Memphis, New Orleans and other prominent cities. Where these have been built they have proven exceedingly popular, not only for the enjoyment they afford, but from a sanitary standpoint; as the exhilirating effect is conducive to health especially for the ladies, so much so that many prominent physicians have prescribed coaster riding to their patients.  From the chief justice of the supreme bench of the United States to the humblest plebian the appreciation is universal for both pleasure and health.

<h4 class="title">The New "Roller Coaster."</h4>
Did you ever feel as if you were adrift on the wide, wide sea in a rudderless boat?  Did you ever experience a sensation that convinced you as well as could be convinced without an ocular demonstration that your heart was plumping down into a fathomless void never to resume its proper place?  Did you ever feel as if you were falling into futurity by the most direct and rapid route and attempt to clutch your way back?  If you have never felt so then you have never ridden on a "roller coaster."  If you have ridden on a "roller coaster," these comparisons will seem tame.  If you have not ridden on a "roller coaster," go out to Glenwood Park and experience one of the most peculiar sensations of the nineteenth century.  A reporter of The Gazette stood looking at the large crowd of merry "coasters" yesterday afternoon at Glenwood Park, and wondered a little at the huge amount of fun that the short whirlwind around the snake-shaped track seemed to produce.  A ride only lasts something under a minute, but as bench load after bench load were sent spinning around, the more rosy-cheeked and smiling became the girls and the noisier and happier the boys.  It was just about this time that the reporter took a seat on one of the coasters and was sent on the usual journey.  It was a short one, but crowded full of events.  It is perfectly safe, but as the victim goes whizzing down the narrow track, gaining more momentum each second, all the mean things he ever did come rushing in upon his brains, and just as he is beginning to think he is well out of the serious scrape he seems to be in, a sudden dip at the extreme lowest point of the track makes him think also of oceans of mean things he never did to.  It is a very ingeniously framed instrument of torture for the first attempt.  After that, knowing what to expect, a very pleasant sense of exhilaration, better than anything that champagne could ever produce, follows the coaster.  After several round the reporter understood hos so seemingly simple sport sent the blood coursing through the veins, and produced such happy laughter amongst the participants.
<p>
Yesterday afternoon was the opening of the "roller-coaster" by L. W. Gast & Co., who are now running Glenwood Park. ... The "roller coaster" will be one of the most busily engaged, from the present outlook, of any in the country.

The first accident of any importance that was reported occurred on the roller coaster at the Island early in the afternoon.  Presumably to keep boys from climbing over the rails of the lower parts of the coaster, a barb wire fence has been placed around them, about four feet from the coaster itself.  A car containing nine persons, when it had reached the lower part of the structure, suddenly jumped the track and precipitated the occupants with great violence over the rail, several of them being hurled against the barbed wire fence.  ...

There will be a new device for giving amusement to the patrons of Chautauqua this season.  P. H. Weaver, of Jamestown, will have a roller coaster on the grounds, which is a circular runway, built upon stilts, one edge touching the ground and that opposite elevated high in the air; the runway having a track on which a car is placed.  Starting from the highest point the car, loaded with people, speeds down the incline and gains nearly sufficient momentum to reach the summit or starting point.  It is coasting without any walking up hill.  This form of amusement has been very popular wherever introduced.

<h4 class="title">Scenes At Chautauqua.</h4>
Another novelty at Chautauqua this season is the "circular gravity railway."  It is an invention only about eighteen months old, yet has come rapidly into favor at watering places and other resorts. It is a circular railway, with a circuit of 500 feet, built upon trestle work, with a grade, first, rapidly descending, and then ascending to the place of starting.  The track is a two-foot gauge, of light iron rails.  The car, mounted on four wheels, is about the size of a lumber wagon box, with a seat with convenient backs running along one side, like the seat of an omnibus.  It will accommodate eight persons.  The car, started from the upper level, glides and rushes along the descending grade with a rapidly increasing velocity, until it reaches the lower level, from which the momentum carries it along the opposite ascending grade, to nearly the same level from whence it had set out.  A little pushing by an attendant brings it easily to the upper level.  The sensation caused by a ride over this railway is exciting and exhilarating.  The ride, the first time, usually is begun with a kind of cautious look ahead, but it invariably ends with the broadest kind of a smile.

... we set out to investigate the amusement side of Chautauqua.  The first "dash" we made was for the roller coaster.  We took a seat alongside of about ten other sinners and started down the plunge for the round trip, and had only got under comfortable headway when one poor sinner remarked, with something of emphasis, that "she went like the devil," and for my part I thought we were going to see his Satanic majesty straightway, and momentarily wished I had not cast aside my Sunday gown.  But we finally touched the bottom of the third and final plunge, sailed gracefully up the "home stretch," landed all "hunky-dory," and didn't ask any odds of the devil or anybody else.  Then we took several more trips and pronounced the coaster the great feature of amusement it was represented to be.

Just as Capt. Johnson, the manager of the roller coasting circle at Peak's Island, touched the lever to start a car on its flying errand, he saw a little girl run down the track of the terminus.  He ran as fast as he could in pursuit of her from the home shoot of the car after its terrific speed of more than a mile a minute.  It seems that the girl of eight years had run to the track to rescue a little tot of three, in her charge, which had wandered down there and had hidden from sight when the car was started.  Capt. Johnson seized the larger child and threw her over the track fence, but such was the speed of the car that she fell in the laps of the passengers and at the same instant was knocked over the fence, falling a distance of several feet.  Miraculous to say, the little stray one had been struck by the wheel of the car and dropped at the feet of the passengers, comparatively uninjured.  The girl was hurt but a trifle, but Johnson, who is quite a heavy man, very seriously bruised.

The great change in the sentiments of the people is to be found in the fact that yesterday the roller coaster was kept running for hours, and no one interfered.  London must be striving to eclipse its great namesake--in disregard for the day of rest.--[Hamilton Times.]  The roller coaster was taken possession of by a lot of boys ranging from 10 to 15 years of age.  A policeman did interfere, but the boys were at it again as soon as his back was turned.

A new amusement is running at Dundurn park, and people who delight in novel sensations should take it in. On the bank beyond the west lawn a circular track has been laid. It starts at a height of probably 30 feet from the ground, gradually works down and then rises again, and its circumference is over 500 feet. A car starts at the top with a load of people, whizzes around, and in less than eight seconds gets back again. It is carried up the ascent by its own gravitation. It has caught on in Toronto and wherever it has been tried, and there is no particular reason why it shouldn't be as popular here as elsewhere. The sensation is delightful, and those who have tried it consider it the finest fun going. The public will have an opportunity of trying it at the carpenters' and joiners' picnic to-day.

Fitzgerald claimed on the stand the he was merely there as a looker-on, and rode around the coaster as a complimentary passenger.  He had no ticket.  He admitted that he had an interest in the "United States Gravity Railroad," covered by patents, entitling it to convey passengers between points.  He denied that he was present at any game, sport or diversion on Sunday.  The court adjudged him guilty and fined him $15 and costs.  He appealed and was held in $300 for the Superior Court.  The same programme will be repeated next Sunday if the coaster is run.

The proprietors of a roller coaster at the Willows, Salem, were arrested Sunday for running the coaster on that day, and being bailed, complaint was made against a conductor of a street car for running a horse car on Sunday.  The proprietors claim that their coaster stands exactly in the relation of the horse railroad; that it is the "United States gravity railroad" by the title of its patent, and entitled to carry passengers between points.

To the Editor of The Globe:<br>
Knowing that your valuable space is ever at the disposal of correspondents on matters of general interest, the undersigned, while lacking the ability necessary in portraying what can justly be called a burlesque on justice, respectfully asks for space to describe the proceedings of the First District Court, on yesterday morning, in the ancient city of Salem, renowned from the fact that here were executed for the crime of witchcraft more than twenty persons for what was then known (1692) as Salem witchcraft.  All vestiges of this ancient influence, except the trees whereon the persons found guilty were executed, and a monument recently erected to commemorate them as martyrs have disappeared.  Nevertheless, the judicial mind of Salem is even yet clouded so as to prevent the perceptions of right and wrong.  That this statement is true is most amply verified by the minions of the law while they were convicting the undersigned and another gentleman for a violation of the laws, in participating in a "game of amusement and recreation on the Lord's day" by riding on the "United States Patented Gravity" railroad, on Sunday, August 2.  There were ten cases of inebriation before the court.  Although all saloons are supposed to be closed on Sundays, these men and women procured their drink in the city of Salem.  Perhaps the license law could not be fully enforced yesterday, owing to the fact that the city marshal would be compelled, if the so-called roller coaster management decided to run contrary to law, to detail an officer to arrest each conductor who would dare start the cars on the "elevated railroad." However, the drunks were before his honor, and in each case he inflicted fines varying from $1 to $5 and costs, this for fighting, quarrelling and being drunk on the Lord's day. More condign punishment was necessary for the crime of riding on the "elevated railway," and accordingly His Honor Judge Osgood, with a facial appearance of magnanimity which would have been creditable to a fond parent giving a loving daughter away to a deserving groom, imposed a fine of $15 and costs on the two gentlemen then under his judicial ire. But why reflect on Judge Osgood's action in this matter? or on that of City Marshal Hart, who refused to arrest a conductor or driver on a street railway without a warrant from Judge Osgood, which be know would not be granted?  Or on that of Assistant Marshal Skinner, who refused to execute a complaint against a driver or conductor without a warrant even though complainant would point him out the culprit in the act of violating a Sunday law.  Was a warrant surreptitiously issued on Saturday for the arrest of any person or conductor starting the railroad in question on Sunday?  Or if a warrant was not necessary for the arrest of Powers on Sunday, why was it deemed necessary for the arrest of other persons whose violation of the law was not less flagrant than that of Powers?  These are pertinent questions, broadly asked by a citizen of the United States, one who would lay down his life to maintain its laws, an Irishman by birth and proclivities, a Catholic by education, and in politics a Republican by choice.  These are pertinent questions, openly asked of my fellow-citizens, strangers to me, who are secretly urging the city authorities to enforce obsolete laws, while modern violations of the law go openly unchecked. The undersigned is and always has been desirous of upholding that which is right and condemning that which is wrong.  Therefore it cannot be entirely laid to my personal feeling if l charge the original complainant against the "roller coaster" with moral cowardice in not openly making the charge against the management of this legitimate investment. Why do men of that ilk go about on Sunday with a dark lantern, figuratively speaking, shedding its rays on the molehill while the mountain goes unobserved?  Let us, as Mr. Hal Newton Carlyle, the able editor of Salem's Evening Telegram, remarks, "call a spade a spade, a liar a liar," etc. Let us do this, and call a hypocrite a hypocrite, and let him be known as such. Let us have innocent rational amusement on Sundays, or else let not distinctions be made without a difference, and let there be no one-sided enforcement of the Sunday law in Salem.  Perhaps it will interest the city marshal to learn that, after he had arrested the conductor and while the manager was procuring his bail, a complaint was made to the regular officer on duty near the coaster that persons had forcibly put the cars on the track again, and were running them in defiance of the young man left temporarily in charge of them, who pointed out the persons so doing to this officer, Thomas Smith by name, and invoked his aid in preventing the cars from being damaged by the irresponsible parties who had forcibly placed them on the track. The officer stoutly refused to protect the property. The result is a damage of $100 or more to the cars. The roller coaster at Salem Willows is a legitimate railway, destined for the pleasure and recreation of the people. The management have as much, but no more, right to run its cars on Sunday than have the Naumkeag street railway or any of the other lines in this city, and if the Sunday law is to be impartially enforced the latter will not run in Salem next Sunday. <br>

<h4 class="title">A Roller Coaster in Court.</h4>
To-day's Sunday law sensation comes from the staid old town of Salem ...  At the Salem Willows, a popular picnic resort, a roller-coaster has been built.  It was run all day last Sunday for the first time.  Good citizens protested, and demanded that the unholy amusement of the world's people be stopped.  Previously a similar effort had been made to stop a roller-coaster in Lynn, but without success.  This morning Marshal Hart went down to the Willows and found the roller-coaster running full tilt. M. D. Fitzgerald, Mortimer Chandler and Francis L. Powers were in charge of the machine.  Marshal Hart told them not to run it.  Fitzgerald started the car and was at once arrested.  The names of the other two proprietors with those of the passengers on the car were taken.  The management concluded that it was no use to try to run the machine.  In the excitement the car was left unattended for an hour, and the boys had a delightful time running the thing as they pleased till a smash-up ended their fun.  Mr. Powers was furious at what he termed the unwarranted interference of the law with his legitimate business.  His company, he says, is incorporated under the name of "The United States Gravity Railroad."  He claims that it should be treated just as other railroads are, and that he has the right to carry passengers from station to station just as any elevated railroad would have.

This roller coaster was set up under the plea of being the United States Gravity Railroad, with privilege to carry passengers between two points, the points being close beside each other and the cars returning almost to the point started from.  Under this plea the coaster was run on Sunday in violation of the law and was promptly suppressed by Marshal Hart.  The apparatus was locked up, but boys broke into it and hence the suit was brought.

<h4 class="title">Squelched by a Decision.<br>
Concluding Chapter in the History of the United States Gravity Railroad.</h4>
The "United States Gravity Railroad," a Salem railroad with an interesting local history, representing an original expenditure, it is said, of $1200, was sold at auction yesterday afternoon by S. A. Johnson to Mrs. S. J. Beach for $102.  The railroad is to be removed, and the material of which it is composed will enter into the construction of a barn.
<p>
The railroad was familiarly known as the "roller coaster."  Its original proprietor determined to run it upon Sundays, but Salem sentiment and the City Fathers frowned upon such an idea.  One attempt was made to defy the powers that were and to run the railroad on the seventh day.  It resulted in inglorious failure.  When brought to the bar the proprietor declared that he was running a railroad--the United States Gravity Railroad--the cars going down one side of the coaster and up the other, thus connecting two points which were within eight feet of each other at the top, but still two points, as was gravely argued to the Court.  Being a railroad, it was urged by the defense that it was not amenable to that Court, that it came under the control of the Railroad Commissioners, and that it had the same right to run its cars as any other railroad on Sundays.  Though the defense was unique, Judge Safford failed to see it in any such light, and effectually laid an embargo as good as a permanent injunction on the road and its cars by imposing a penalty.  
<p>
The United States Gravity Railroad went out of business, and its plant has been slowly dropping to pieces, abandoned and unused from that day to this.  There was no intercession by the Railroad Commissioners that anybody heard of.

It is his intention to make a great resort out of the Lake as soon as Mr. Menegay's lease expires.  He will build several new buildings about where the roller coaster now stands.

<h4 class="title">A Novel Attraction</h4>
The directors of the State Fair Association are making the necessary preparations for the erection of one of Yearick's gravity-railways on the Fair Grounds, designing to have it completed and in working order before the opening of the Fair.  The affair is a sort of perpetual motion coasting apparatus, and consists of two inclined tracks, upon which small cars run, so arranged that on leaving the platform the car descends a steep incline to the level of the ground, and by the momentum thus gained starts back on another track to the same height as the starting point, from which the journey is repeated ad infinitum.  The railways are in operation in Toledo, New Orleans, Memphis and other cities.

The State Fair Association has contracted with the patentee of "Yearick's Gravity Railway" for a roller coaster to be erected on the State Fair Grounds.  This coaster is on a different plan from the ordinary ones, not being in circular form, but the return track is directly over the other.  It is very popular where in use.

The young men of Knoxville have concluded that a roller coaster is just what is wanted here.  They can buy one in Chattanooga and have it erected here for one thousand dollars.  They have formed a stock company and succeeded in disposing of one half of the shares.  That the city is to have a roller coaster now is an assured fact.

<h4 class="title">No Roller Coaster<br>
A Stock Company Organized to Build One, but it goes to Pieces on the Start.</h4>
A short time ago a stock company consisting of some five or six members was partially organized for the purpose of building and operating a roller coaster.  The intention was to have it put up on the vacant lot opposite the Opera House, and it was estimated that the total cost would be about $1,000.  Stock to that amount was to have been issued had the scheme proceeded successfully.  Some of the leaders of the enterprise, fearing that the present dull times might prevent their plan from being a financial success, were inclined to back out after the preliminary steps had been taken, and some of the members of the proposed company disagreeing, it was finally decided to throw up the sponge.  As a result Oshkosh will have no roller coaster just at present unless different parties take up the undertaking where it has been dropped.  A prominent rink manager, and a young man engaged in the manufacturing business were among those who were interested.  It is seems to be believed by many that on account of dull times, and the craze for roller skating which existed last winter, the prospects for making a roller coaster pay are rather slim, and that interest in it would be rather short lived.  A trip around a machine like the one which was to have been built is made in about thirteen seconds, and the cost of two rides is usually a nickel.

What Was Done by the Park Committee on Superintendence Yesterday.</h4>
At the meeting of the Park Commission Committee on Police and Superintendence yesterday, Lewis M. Hough, civil engineer, and who is professor of civil engineering at the Pennsylvania University, asked for permission to build a toboggan coaster in the Park, similar to the one in use at Atlantic City.  Two sheds are to be erected parallel to each other, each 500 feet long and eight feet wide.  One of these will be used for the going and the other for the returning coasters.  The grades are undulating and the force of gravity will carry the coasters from one end to the other.  These coasters will be placed on wheels.  The site selected is in the East Park, on the edge of the base ball ground, which abuts the Reading Railroad.  The matter was referred to Mr. Boker.

The roller coaster is as great a craze in the east as was roller skating. Two rides for five cents is cheap enough amusement for any one.
